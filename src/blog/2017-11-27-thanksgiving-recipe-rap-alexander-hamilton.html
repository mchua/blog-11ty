<p><em>For context: my family's Thanksgiving tradition is that we do it potluck-style, and everyone prepares a dish matching some kind of theme, often a goofy one. For instance, last year's theme was "Literature," so we had Watership Down salad, Oliver Twist "more" soup, etc. This year's theme was "It's a (w)rap," which covered either food encased in other food and/or food related to rap music.Â </em></p>
<p><em>Also for context: I learned that there's a dish called Chicken Alexander, which is basically Chicken a la King with a mashed potato crust, and immediately thought "oh, I could use pork instead, and thennnn..."</em><em><br />
</em></p>
<p><em>Also for context: play <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZPDnhTNPeM">this music</a> in the background (will be obvious from the title even if you don't listen) - and you may be able to replicate my performance introducing this dish at the Thanksgiving table.</em></p>
<p>how does some carrots, onions, chardonnay and cream<br />
of mushroom soup that get dropped into the middle of a slow boiled<br />
pot of shredded kale ribbons to add a little green<br />
match up with our Thanksgiving theme?</p>
<p>this ten-dollar bottle of supermarket wine will add a lot o'<br />
flavor into the pot, that little alcoholic mottle<br />
that goes full throttle to hit the spot, it'll<br />
be the efficient cause of the deliciousness, to ref'rence Aristotle</p>
<p>and every day when I was slaving away over my papers<br />
trying to hack the tenure track with my researcher labors,<br />
inside, I really needed some distractionary capers<br />
from the day to day press of all my scholarship endeavours</p>
<p>then this rap came, and the recipe came, and I had it<br />
since these parody songs have been a childhood habit<br />
and a day or two off writing isn't really all that bad,<br />
it became a plain diversion from the pain of my whole train</p>
<p>of thought - I have to do my edits, really should abstain, man<br />
planning out a recipe around a rap is vain, man<br />
focus on your work, not on the Thanksgiving main, man<br />
but I'm sorry, my left brain<br />
it's just insane, man</p>
<p>Alexander Hamilton<br />
This dish is Alexander Hamilton<br />
I planned this recipe around that pun<br />
So just you wait, just you wait</p>
