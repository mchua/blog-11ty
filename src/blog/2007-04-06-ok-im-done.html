<p>I just spent the <span style="font-style: italic;">entire morning</span> spewing out prolific streams of <span style="font-style: italic;">stuff </span>onto the keyboard. I think I can stop now and do work, if only because my wrists are starting to get sore from typing. Apologies to readers who suddenly find themselves with this huge textdump. I considered saving everything as a draft and just releasing one new post a day, but that wouldn't have been very honest; this is a brainstream and stands as such.</p>
<p>My work habits are ridiculous sometimes.</p>
