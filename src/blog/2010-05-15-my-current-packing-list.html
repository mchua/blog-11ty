<p>I'm starting to get better at the travel thing, and since I'm going to spend this summer on the road, I figured it was time to document my current travel setup, which consists of 1 backpack + 1 guitar. I may rearrange this to become 1 suitcase + 1 guitar, with the backpack comprising most of the interior of the suitcase, but we'll see.<b></p>
<p>Back compartment:</b>
<ul>
<li>Laptop, laptop power cable</li>
<li>Wireless keyboard and mouse</li>
<li>Portable laptop stand</li>
<li>Any papers I'm carrying for work or study</li>
<li>Any books/software I'm working through, including music books</li>
<li>Anti-RSI tools</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Middle compartment:</b>
<ul>
<li>Running shoes</li>
<li>Dancing shoes</li>
<li>Clothes for the week, including 1 pair of either nice or non-nice pants (whichever one I'm not wearing), 1 light pair of running/pajama pants, and rolled-up t-shirts (and usually one shirt that's not a t-shirt)</li>
<li>Some sort of portable exercise thingy, when I get one - Greg recommended exercise bands, I'll have to check into that.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Front top compartment:</b>
<ul>
<li>Toothbrush and toothpaste</li>
<li>Travel comb</li>
