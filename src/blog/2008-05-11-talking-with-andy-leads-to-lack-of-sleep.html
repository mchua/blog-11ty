<p><a href="http://www.oneofthewolves.com/2008/05/08/wopr-pre-wopr/">Wooo Tim!</a> TOPP sent him to a testing conference where he presented "Tim-bits" after each group discussion, summarizing it from the viewpoint of a relative newcomer to the field. "For a newbie out of college, this was some pressure," said Tim... but it looks like he did an amazing job. My favorite note is this one: "Tools donâ€™t solve problems, they help people solve problems. Like a hammer <em>helps</em> in building a roof, our tools <em>help </em>in doing performance testing. No one tool will do our work for us." (Goranka Bjedov, Google)</p>
<p>Now, Andy. Every time I visit Olin and stay at Andy P's, we end up talking until at <i>least</i> 4am. This time it was about education (which isn't unusual) and self-directed learning (also not unusual) and ended up with Things Happening (...also not unusual). The most "exciting" parts went something like this.</p>
<p>"I want to start a virtual school."<br />"I'll enroll as a student. Here are some courses of study I'd like to do. Are you joining me?"<br />"Yes! How about an MBA?"</p>
<p>Several hours of research later, we now have an "MBA Learning Plan" (we're aware it's going to change as we start going through it). The "MBA" part is a mild misnomer since it consists of the things we'd want to learn at a "traditional" MBA program, doesn't have the things we don't think are important (this is different from the things we're gritting our teeth about learning but are doing anyway - for instance, we're not psyched about covering accounting, but we will) and includes a couple topics outside the usual scope of MBA programs. For me, about half the things in the (year-long, currently) study plan were things I was already doing and looking into, but wanted to be forced to reflect on, so it's deepening my current activities rather than adding onto them.</p>
<p>For reference, here are the two things I'd want to get out of an MBA (Andy made me write them down):</p>
<p>The first objective would be to learn how to run an open-source company (and what that means) with a focus on project/company lifecycles and how people fit into/react within various roles in an organization, both formally and emergently defined.</p>
<p>The second objective would be to understand my own career and personal growth as something separate from the organizations I'm affiliated with, because I believe I'm at my best (both for myself and the organizations I work with/for) when I'm working within and across multiple groups at once (be that a part-time job while doing graduate studies, working full-time and volunteering heavily at a separate organization, or whatever).</p>
<p>The second conversation went something like this:</p>
<p>"I'd like to start a business someday."<br />"Ok, let's do that before we go to sleep (it was ~5:20am, and we slept before 6)."</p>
<p>So... yeah. Our target date is public launch before Olin's graduation (next Sunday). Stay tuned. We also need to find a place to keep track of our "MBA" studies. Wikiversity again, perhaps?</p>
<p>Working backwards chronologically: the garden on top of the parking lot by my office is a <i>wonderful</i> place to have lunch, and Henry Hardy is my hero. I think I would benefit from throwing myself "backward in time" and learning how to write really <i>tight</i> assembly and C, playing with very old computers or things that roughly approximate them. It might get me past my "but I'm expected to know this and now I feel stupid" hangup-block that (I believe) stops me from making rapid progress in computing/programming and electrical engineering type things. Of course, it's also important to not get so hung-up on not learning "fast enough" that I... don't learn at all. (Once I start thinking metacognitively, stopping that infinite reflection recursion is like not thinking of a purple elephant sometimes.)</p>
<p>Wednesday night was also delightful. It was Kristen Dorsey's birthday (hello, old one!) and a whole lot of us went down to John Harvard's to consume copious amounts of cholesterol-laden food, then to Kristen's house to hang out and catch up and generally have fun times. It turned out that our entire suite (the su<a href="http://ieee.org">IEEE</a>te suite) was present, the first time we'd been all together since graduation, and everybody is doing <i>great</i>. Kristen and I argued about who'd earned the least money this year (she's volunteering at starvation wages for <a href="http://usfirst.org">FIRST</a> before heading to grad school at CMU in the fall, I'm on my year off and pulling down occasional internship stipends while paying travel expenses).</p>
<p>I wanted to head back to the office and work, so they dropped me off at the train station by dangerously overloading Jeff's car. I ended up clutching the shotgun seat's headrest and sitting mostly on the rear passenger-side seat's door handle, wedged between that and Gallimore's knee. It's nice to be around people I trust and know well enough to physically touch past the functional hand-lending and the social handshake or hug - backrubs, piggyback-rides, hair-rumples, and so on. It's one of those "don't realize how much you missed it" things; I realized this two hours into the get-together when I thought "wait, wait... I'm <i>leaning against somebody </i>(VanWyk) and feel <i>perfectly comfortable</i> and didn't even notice it!" I'm usually very shy about and aware of physical contact with other people, so being able to let my guard down was great.</p>
