<p>We just finished a big last-minute sprint in the #teachingopensource IRC channel to push our <a href="http://teachingopensource.org/index.php/OSCON_2010#Submissions_status">OSCON track proposal</a> through. </p>
<p>Here are the five I'm listed for:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://teachingopensource.org/index.php/5_FOSS_in_Edu_projects_that_changed_the_world_-_OSCON_2010">5 FOSS in Edu projects that changed the world</a> (Karsten Wade, Mel Chua)</li>
<li><a href="http://teachingopensource.org/index.php/OSCON_2010#Junior_Jobs_and_Bite-sized_bugs:_Entry_points_for_new_contributors_to_open_source">Junior Jobs and Bite-sized bugs: Entry points for new contributors to open source</a> (Mel Chua, Asheesh Laroia)</li>
<li><a href="http://teachingopensource.org/index.php/OSCON_2010#Teaching_FOSS_to_Undergraduates">Teaching FOSS to Undergraduates</a> (Ralph Morelli, Luis Ibanez, Carlos Jensen, Mel Chua, Timothy Budd, Leslie Hawthorn)</li>
<li><a href="http://teachingopensource.org/index.php/OSCON_2010#POSSE">Teaching Open Source Has A POSSE</a> (Professors Open Source Summer Experience) (Mel Chua)</li>
<li>The Open Source Way: Leveraging Communities (Sebastian Dziallas, Mel Chua)</li>
</ol>
<p>As a first-time proposer, I was amazed to see how quickly things came together, snowballing right up until the very end. A few minutes before the deadline, proposals were still being written - for the one I was in, Asheesh was filling in the outline Karsten had set down while Jeff caught typos and I copy-pasted the finished bits into the OSCON proposal submission page. We got it in <i>right</i> under the deadline. (In other news, etherpad kicks some serious butt.)</p>
<p>I'm hopeful that our track (and at least some of our talks) will be accepted - I definitely want to see... oh, pretty much all the talks listed. July should be a fun month for travel this summer.</p>
<p>In other news, the road trip back to Boston (from Raleigh) continues. I've made it to New York, staying with <a href="http://www.harihareswara.net/">Sumana</a> and <a href="http://www.crummy.com/">Leonard</a>. Many thanks to <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/PaulWFrields">Paul</a> and his family for putting me up last night (complete with affectionate dog resulting in my pants <i>still</i> having dog hair on them - but I'm happy about this, since my opportunities to get covered in dog hair are far less frequent than I would like them to be).</p>
<p>It is nearly 4am, which means unconsciousness shall claim me shortly. Farewell to the waking world for a few hours.</p>
