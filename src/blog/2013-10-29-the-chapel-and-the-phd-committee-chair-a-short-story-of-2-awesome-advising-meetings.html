<p>"How <em>are </em>you, Mel?" Robin asked.</p>
<p>I slumped against my advisor's office door until it clicked shut, and grinned. "I'm... proud of how I'm responding to repeatedly falling on my ass in chaos." I dumped a pile of post-its on the table representing <em>everything </em>academic I was working on this school year and asked her to help prioritize and cut them, including things I was supposed to give her. ("You know that it's not that I <em>want </em>to cut corners or slack; but if it doesn't <em>need </em>to be as shiny as I'm thinking now, then I'm <em>going </em>to make these slides with Sharpies the night before my presentation and have more time to focus on the more important stuff.")</p>
<p>90 minutes later, I strode out of Robin's office with an even broader smile and a relaxed spring in my step. I love having her as an advisor because -- well, I try to come to our meetings with my research in as good a state as I can get it, but I know that I can come to her in <em>any </em>state so long as I'm trying, and we will use our time together to make even the most ridiculous mess better. Not perfect; that's a lifetime's work. But better than it was.</p>
<p>Rewind 5 hours earlier. I'm dragging my feet towards the chapel, a bit embarrassed. My mind's going a million places at a million paces a minute. I <em>know </em>my day goes better when I spend time in contemplation -- it brings this weird slow inner renewal that lets me be a Better Mel. And yet. I'm busy, dammit. Also: <em>I'm in an awful shape to pray,</em> I think, falling slightly into my old patterns of beating myself up. <em>I should be better!</em> And then I step in and remember my odd recent mental image of God as infinitely awesome grad school advisor -- the kind who wants you to surprise them, question <em>everything</em>, smiles to see your curiosity strengthened by focus and collaboration.</p>
<p>And I sit down, look up, and whisper: "Hey. A bit messed up today, but I'm here -- and that's why I'm here." ("By the way, I got distracted by your awesome bookshelf on the way in. Oops.")</p>
<p>And 30 minutes later, I am <em>running </em>through the parking lot with glad determination and a <em>lot </em>of things to drop (responsibly) and things to do -- and clarity with which to do them. And it's this momentum that carries me through the hours to Robin's office, where I get another echo of the same.</p>
<p>I thank both my advisors today for showing me the kind of teacher I am growing up to be.</p>
