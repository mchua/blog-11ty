<p>I wrote this in <a href="http://blog.melchua.com/2012/09/28/music-and-feelings-discipline-and-beethoven-and-rage-what-should-i-hear/">September of last year</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s much, much easier to not know what you’ve missed, not know what you are missing, especially if it’s likely that you’ll always, always miss it. But I resolved a long time ago to choose awareness over absence of pain, and while I falter often on that resolution, it’s still something I strive for; the falterings usually happen along the way to picking myself up repeatedly and trying to be brave enough again, again, again.</p></blockquote>
<p>I am surprised at how much more true it's become.</p>
