<p>It's past 2am, so I've decided that:
<ol>
<li>I've done enough POSSE stuff for one day.</li>
<li>My presentation for tomorrow's lecture is as good as it is ever going to be. I'm working with a I've got high hopes.</li>
<li>I'm going to worry about burning 40 copies of live media... later. (Dear lazyweb: there isn't a <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/get-prerelease?wkanF13a">F13</a> live image that fits on a CD, is there? The tricky part is that we'd like them to have a live image of something more recent than F12 so they can preview things but <i>not</i> have to install to hard disk... and I don't have a DVD burner, just a CD burner and CDs. I guess I <i>could</i> burn them the KDE spin.)</li>
</ol>
<p>My hands now hurt from typing, so I'm going to go to sleep. More on this "Fedora in the classroom" thing later; I'm just thinking out loud right now so people know what's on my mind in this respect - I'll write more about our approach later, once class is over.</p>
