<p>Before watching the following, please note that:</p>
<ul>
<li>I do not play drums; this was me on an electronic drumset that's clattering against the wall as I play, trying to keep some sort of beat (beat cribbed from "The Drum Set Crash Course"). During the course of events, the pad corresponding to the kick fell over and I resorted to trying to whack it with my toe. Also, I can't hear the crash, ride, or hi-hat.</li>
<li>I got a guitar in Wellington less than a week ago, and don't quite know how to play it yet. This is after 2 pages of "A Modern Method For Guitar" and the memory of the single Magic Chord Of Slidingness (Wikipedia says it's called a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barre_chord">barre chord</a>) I was taught by... somebody in college, turned into some semblance of 12 bar blues.</li>
<li>I do not play bass, and as such was reduced to uninspired thumping on a digital keyboard set to "Wood Bass" voicing.</li>
<li>I may have met the C blues scale in passing on the keyboard, but certainly not in E before.</li>
<li>In Ye Grande Olde Tradition of posting all my mistakes, this was the first take of <em>everything</em>. Forget "best track." This is the only track.</li>
</ul>
<p>With that in mind - today I decided I was going to learn how to string a guitar, tune a guitar, lay down multiple tracks, and upload my recording in a form that would be easily viewable On Teh Intarwebz.</p>
<p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="344" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/O5CNRLs-USo&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/O5CNRLs-USo&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p>
<p>There is a certain kind of comfort in knowing that it can only improve from here.</p>
