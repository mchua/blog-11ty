<p>Okay, folks. I'm choreographing my first solo. I might not get to perform it until the spring -- or even next fall, depending -- but having the guts to get up and do a solo is something I'd like to do. (Bravery exercises! Face ALL the fears!)</p>
<p>I <em>want </em>to do it to the song "Fever" -- anyone who does swing or blues should know this song, and anyone who <a href="http://www.lyrics007.com/Ella%20Fitzgerald%20Lyrics/Fever%20Lyrics.html">knows the lyrics</a> should now be saying "Mel? You? Solo? To <em>that</em>?" Yep yep. (Face ALL the fears!) Okay, okay, there's a twist to it that I won't reveal now but which will make this all make sense once the piece is finished. But it is a pretty, um, sexy-sounding song, and... I'm actually honoring that.)</p>
<p>Now I need to pick a particular cover to dance to, and that's where you come in, o people with more music knowledge than I.</p>
<p>I am looking for something slow, bluesy, simple -- male or female vocalist doesn't matter, but I want the percussion to be bursty and loud and sudden, especially in phrases like "Fever / &lt;DRUM!&gt; / In the morning" or "Fever / &lt;DRUM!&gt; / I'm a fire", and I want the accompanying track to be sparse (in my perfect world, it's just a vocalist, a drummer, and a bassist). And in case it makes a difference, I'm going to have to cut the thing for time, and will almost definitely be nixing the Pocahontas verse.</p>
<p>So far, the best one I've found is (I think) this Peggy Lee version -- it's pretty sparse, and I love the swinging female vocals, but it's a bit faster than I'd like, and the drum is not as prominent as I could wish. (I guess you could mix it to slow the sound down and amplify the drums, but I don't know how to do that.)</p>

<p>Alternatives: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9Ht1q9psfY">Elvis Presley's cover is too big-band</a>, and the original <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i93-hlwULUk">Little Willie John </a>doesn't have the percussion I want. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjcHbb2BOGU">Ella Fitzgerald</a> cover is lovely but awfully fast. The <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ynp_NK82Bc">Rose McGowan</a> cover has a great tempo -- if anything, it's a little too slow! but is only part of the song, and missing the percussion.</p>
<p>Go go go!</p>
