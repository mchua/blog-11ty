<p>All right, I think I've figured out what bothers me about Clay Shirky's <a href="http://www.shirky.com/weblog/2010/01/a-rant-about-women">rant about women</a>. It's because I read it as saying this:
<ol>
<li>The world can be sucky and unfair to women who don't use aggressive male-like strategies to promote themselves.</li>
<li>So women should use more aggressive male-like strategies to promote themselves.</li>
<li>Yep, it's sucky and unfair that the burden should fall on women to do this sort of thing. Tough.</li>
</ol>
<p>It isn't that I disagree with any of these points - but there's a missing part. Compare:
<ol>
<li>Hey, this $cool_technology I use has $inconvenience for folks who have a certain $preference.</li>
<li>So folks with $preference should use $alternative_action to do $thing_they_wanted_to_do, even if it's difficult and bothersome for them.</li>
<li>Yep, it's sucky and unfair that the burden should fall on people with said $preference. Tough.</li>
</ol>
<p>To which my immediate reaction - to both - is "HEY! Aren't we hackers? Isn't the point not that the world may not be what we want it to be, but that even if it is, <i>we can change that?</i>"</p>
<p>This doesn't mean the world is <i>not</i> sucky and unfair in the ways described. This doesn't mean short-term coping solutions need to be deployed to cope with that immediate reality. It does mean that those coping solutions should be just that - short-term. That what we should do, if we're truly troubled with this situation, is to find our own ways - little ways - to contribute to making that solution as short-term as possible for as many people as possible.</p>
<p>Here's the patch I would have liked to apply.</p>
<blockquote><p>"It may be possible for the world to someday be less sucky and unfair about this sort of thing. Here is what that may look like and how we - of any gender - can help get us there, and how people have already been doing this for quite some time."</p></blockquote>
<p>Thinking and writing about this is a start. A great start. The next step is to be actively conscious of not using "learned helpnessness" as a reason to not proactively do something about the situation (which, ironically, is criticizing a group for being disadvantaged due to socially-inculcated "learned helpnessness"). And yes, actively looking for opportunities to help is, in itself, a way and opportunity to help. </p>
<p>As <a href="http://twitter.com/MemeR">Meme</a> <a href="http://www.shirky.com/weblog/2010/01/a-rant-about-women/comment-page-1/#comment-2205">commented</a> on the original post (thanks to <a href="http://hoydenabouttown.com/20100117.7163/shirkys-rant-about-women/">tigtog</a> for highlighting this comment):</p>
<blockquote><p>"It can be called a second-wave chauvinistic approach: assuming women are flawed because they don’t deal well with the system, instead of assuming the system is flawed because it doesn’t work for women."</p></blockquote>
<p>Ok, yes, there are ways in which the system sucks. But look - we're hackers. Let's go fix it.</p>
