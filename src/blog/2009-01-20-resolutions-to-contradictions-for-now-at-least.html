<p>I'm in Australia at long last. Arriving here at LCA was... more of an adventure than I bargained for (but a most excellent one). More on this later.</p>
<p>Two days, two resolutions to contradictions that have plagued me for quite some time.</p>
<p>The first is from a long discussion with Yifan about the problem of communication between members of a community balanced with the desire to have that community be decentralized. After a frustratingly incoherent (my fault) conversation, she went back into the room and I cooked dinner - then sprinted into the bedroom with a sudden thought.</p>
<blockquote><p>Me: Wait, you were trying to tell me that what you want is centralized <em>communication</em>, but decentralized <em>action</em>?</p>
<p>Yifan: Yes! [probable subtext: That's what I've been trying to <em>tell</em> you for an <em>hour</em>.]</p></blockquote>
<p>The second is the contradiction between taking initiative and being invisible so others can shine - this one is thanks to Marco.</p>
<blockquote><p>I think that sometimes if you are trying to maximize effectiveness in a project, your visibility has to come and go in cycles. You become visible to build something around you, something that did not exist before, and then once it is a bit solid you pass it to others and become invisible. Repeat</p>
<p>Sometimes it is true that if you don't do it, nobody else will. But once you've done it, someone else can.</p></blockquote>
