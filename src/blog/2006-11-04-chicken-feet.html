<p>Found this from an old email thread about respecting different viewpoints. The issue in question was same-sex unions, but the thing I was trying to say here (however awkwardly) is applicable to a lot of issues (the curriculum revision comes to mind).</p>
<p>
<blockquote>Hi. My name is Mel, and I like eating chicken feet.</p>
<p>Some people think chicken feet are absolutely disgusting. All right, they probably shouldn't be able to prevent me from having my tasty snack. However, do I have the right to say that they can't disagree with the goodness of me eating chicken feet? It's not very nice of them to plaster the dining hall with "CHICKEN FEET EATERS ARE EVIL" and nag me about how my chicken-eating habits will damn me to eternal high cholesterol.</p>
<p>As a considerate and respectful person, it would also not be very mature or nice of me to flaunt eating chicken feet in front of them and call them names ("Chicken feet haters! You're so prejudiced against chicken feet!"). I know it bothers them, and I can't force them to change the fact that they're bothered about it. They know I like chicken feet, and they can't force me to change the fact that I like chicken feet. Well, we can try, but it's frustrating and counterproductive effort to drill your beliefs into someone else's head. If I want them to respect my views on chicken feet, I must show respect for theirs. And not just their right not to eat chicken feet - I need to respect their right to not like that <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I </span></span>eat chicken feet. Subtle yet crucial difference.</p></blockquote>
<p>Thoughts?</p>
