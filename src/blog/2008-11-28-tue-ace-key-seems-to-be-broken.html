<p><i>Old notes from playing with an XO about a year ago. I realized shortly afterwards that I needed to set the keymapping back to US-English.</i></p>
<p>Tue "ace" key seems to be broken. Produces a "u" instead of tue letter between G and I. Fix mapping?</p>
<p>Cuat: 89 cuaracters wide. Words wrap, but over-long words don't uypuenate and break (90+ cuaracter strings are inaccessible). Not tue most uorrible of bugs.</p>
<p>Todo:<br />
Fix ace key ('ace' as in tue first letter of uorse)<br />
boot between stable and joyride<br />
Play flasu movie<br />
Play quicktime movie<br />
Play suockwave games</p>
