<p><em>I like sharing reusable text I come up with. In this case, part of setting up research infrastructure for my lab includes getting everyone into a citation management system and giving us a way to share reading notes. I don't have anything against EndNote or Mendeley (and may someday switch, if massive advantages become apparent), but this email is written for Zotero.</em></p>
<p>Hi, folks – you should have invitations to create Zotero accounts. The only action item you need to take now is following that link and creating an account, which should take a few minutes. You can safely ignore the rest of this email right now, but read on if you want more information/context.</p>
<p>Zotero is a reference management system. It’s useful for keeping track of reading notes and bibliographic information (which we’ll need for our references section every time we write a paper). Other systems include Endnote and Mendeley; there’s no huge advantage of one over the other, but Zotero is (1) familiar to the librarians at RIT and (2) something I already have a lot of notes in, so I’m starting us out with this.</p>
<p>Zotero is free and open source. When you create an account, you’ll probably be prompted to download and install the Zotero browser extension. I prefer to use the standalone desktop software, but that’s your choice.</p>
<p>Right now, the group library is empty. That will change as I begin writing the literature reviews for our ASEE papers. Feel free to add any citations of your own, and/or to start your own individual Zotero libraries (mine is huge; as I find things in it that may be useful to CAT as a whole, I will copy them into the group folder as well).</p>
<p>I have my own conventions for taking notes in Zotero in ways that are easy to write papers from later  – if you really want to, you can read about it here (<a href="http://blog.melchua.com/2015/01/28/how-i-use-zotero-to-take-research-reading-notes/)">http://blog.melchua.com/2015/01/28/how-i-use-zotero-to-take-research-reading-notes/)</a> but I am also happy to show you my system any time we sit down to work together.</p>
<p>Here’s to better research infrastructure!</p>
