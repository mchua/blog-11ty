  or is it the other way around?

<p>Don Davis sent me this nice paper he wrote up with some colleagues - it's a tutorial introduction to the statistics language R that includes a study on legitimate peripheral participation in the GNU/Linux community that uses the software and methodology. Basically, the study is the example they use in the tutorial, or they wrote a tutorial on how they did their study... whichever way you read it, it's pretty cool.</p>
<p>Here's <a href="http://linuxlearningsurveyresults.pbworks.com/w/page/37892313/The-Purpose-and-Theory-Behind-the-Study">the study</a>, and here's <a href="http://linuxlearningsurveyresults.pbworks.com/w/page/34317936/FrontPage">the R tutorial</a>.</p>
<p>R has some nice data manipulation and graphing capabilities - it's something I would love to look into more for tracking class results for TOS professors, as well as the overall TOS and Fedora statistics efforts. If and when I decide to pick it up, you can bet I'll be using Don's tutorial to do so. I wish my statistics class in college had been taught this way!</p>
