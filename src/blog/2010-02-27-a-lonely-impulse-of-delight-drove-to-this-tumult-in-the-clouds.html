<p>I have noticed that a good number of my favorite poems evoke a certain sense of... not quite wanderlust, but the quiet little lifting of your soul that happens when you soar free through a wide, wide, ever-widening universe, somehow happy to be lonely at that moment. Some pieces of this stick so deeply in me that I've memorized them (unintentionally).</p>
<blockquote><p>Nor law, nor duty bade me fight,<br />Nor public men, nor cheering crowds,<br />A lonely impulse of delight<br />Drove to this tumult in the clouds;<br />-- from "An Irish Airman Forsees His Death," by William Butler Yeats</p></blockquote>
<p>This is the sort of stuff that comes to mind when I find myself watching the sun come up from an air mattress next to a luggage of spilled clothes. It's a good life - one that can't last forever, but... well, I'll love it while I can.</p>
<blockquote><p>I must go down to the seas again, to the lonely sea and the sky,<br />And all I ask is a tall ship and a star to steer her by,<br />And the wheel's kick and the wind's song and the white sail's shaking,<br />And a grey mist on the sea's face, and a grey dawn breaking.<br />-- from "Sea Fever," by John Masefield</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All right. I gotta sleep - I get to go see Mark's lab today, which I am quite excited about. It's been so long since I was around active mechanical prototypes. As much as I love software, sometimes I do itch to get my hands on something <i>solid</i>.</p>
