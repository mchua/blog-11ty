<p>My Purdue colleague Nicole Devlin started a YouTube channel called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCub0BSDFfoJJ6p6cEFMZzsg">TL;DR engineering</a> to explain first-year college engineering principles in concise but vivid ways. The videos are captioned! Here's how she captioned them.</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">Recorded high-quality audio.</span></li>
<li>Used YouTube autocaptions (which are automatically generated).</li>
<li>Then -- and this is a crucial step, because the autocaptions <em>were not accurate enough to learn from</em> -- she manually edited the captions for accuracy, using <a href="http://ncdae.org/resources/cheatsheets/youtube.php">these instructions from Google.</a></li>
</ol>
<p>...and that was it! The video is now more accessible to:</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">International students and non-native English speakers</span></li>
<li>Deaf and hard-of-hearing students and those with auditory processing disorders</li>
<li>Students working in a library or other quiet place without headphones, or watching from their phones</li>
<li>Students who want to scroll through the transcript to find a specific word or section</li>
<li>Web search engines (making her videos more search-engine friendly)</li>
<li>...and more.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you want to go even further into caption ninjahood with very little effort, you can edit the caption breaks so they display sentence-by-sentence rather than 3-4 words at a time. This might seem trivial, but it means that you can read an entire thought at one time -- which means you don't need to hold the rest in memory. Imagine reading a book where each word was on a separate page. You'd turn the pages really, really fast (meaning you don't get to see a word for very long), and you would have to hold each word in memory until the thought or sentence completed.</p>
<p>This is less complicated than it sounds. For instance, the current transcript of one video has...</p>
<p><strong>Choppy text</strong><br />
1:00 Laminar flow is the opposite of turbulent flow,<br />
1:03 it's very smooth and regular like when honey flows...<br />
1:07 every molecule has its place. If we look at the Reynolds number for honey,<br />
1:11 the viscosity is very high and<br />
1:15 velocity is very low, which leads to a low<br />
1:18 Reynolds number and laminar flow.</p>
<p>With very little editing, this can become...</p>
<p><strong>Smooth text</strong><br />
1:00 Laminar flow is the opposite of turbulent flow.<br />
1:03 It's very smooth and regular, like when honey flows. Eery molecule has its place.<br />
1:08 If we look at the Reynolds number for honey, the viscosity is very high and velocity is very low,<br />
1:15 which leads to a low Reynolds number and laminar flow.</p>
<p>And that's it, folks. Caption your videos! It's a small one-time job for you, and a long-term higher impact for everyone. Thanks to Nicole for being a great example and captioning hers!</p>
