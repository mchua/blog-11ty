<div style="">Bootcamp day 3 is done!* </p>
<p>See: <a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Grassroots_bootcamp/Results">http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Grassroots_bootcamp/Results</a> </p>
<p>Highlights include: </p>
<ul>
<li>Feedback from Tuesday's classroom roleplay - next round, we need to  find a way to actually work with kids during the bootcamp. This time  around was tough because of end-of-school-year scheduling and  during-the-day bootcamp timing.</li>
<li>Pre-luncheon guests Kim Quirk (VP of Software and Support) and Joe  Feinstein (OLPC's new QA head honcho) came in to talk about how to get  involved in the upcoming surge of community testing. </li>
<li>Guest speaker Josh Gay from the <a href="http://www.fsf.org/">FSF</a> gave a lunch presentation on  "Designing for Participation" - the cycle of defining projects and goals  in such a way that it makes it easy for volunteers to get involved. </li>
<li><a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/User:Sethwoodworth">Seth Woodworth</a> and SJ Klein led a discussion on "community APIs" and what OLPC's community can do to facilitate <i>itself.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>Full notes and transcripts from the day (super-helpful, with much more  detail - most of these transcripts are quite good, thanks to our  volunteers!) are available at  <a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Grassroots_bootcamp/Results/wednesday_transcript">http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Grassroots_bootcamp/Results/wednesday_transcript</a>. </p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
<p>*yes, these notes are getting sent out somewhat belatedly - most of the  bootcampers (myself included) are also recovering from the aftermath of  the Grassroots Jam, <a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Grassroots_Jam">http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Grassroots_Jam</a>.</div>
