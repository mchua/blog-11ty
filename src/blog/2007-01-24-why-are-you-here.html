<p>Yeah, I know, I've taken this class already, two years ago.</p>
<p>But I didn't get it then.</p>
<p>And I want to get it now. Behold the power of spiral learning. I'm hoping that another pass will really make things click for me - I've started to see the fuzzy edges of why Signals and Systems is so awesome, but I can't wield its tools with impunity yet.</p>
<p>I'll be posting my notes here. They won't be class notes per se, but random excursions and variations on a theme - my way of jumping off more and exploring around, since I didn't do that the first time through.</p>
