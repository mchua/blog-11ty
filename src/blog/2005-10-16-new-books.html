<p>MIT SwapFest + MIT Press Loading Dock Sale = Happy, yet broke Mel.</p>
<p>Woke up with a sore throat, which didn't help in our Buttercup rehearsal tonight. I was running between the soprano and tenor parts. It sounds surprisingly... not... bad.</p>
<p>Cleaned room instead of blogging tonight. In bed by 2am will happen! Next up: Awake by 7!</p>
