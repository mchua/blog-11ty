<p>Noting that I cleared more messages from my "it's arrived in the meantime" inbox than from my "backlog" inbox, and that I cleared more than half of my backlog, this is... rather encouraging. Home stretch! Okay, okay, I wimped out. I couldn't get through the entire backlog and I <i>knew</i> there were emails in there I should reply to quickly. I have one more day to get through the last 82 before the script kicks in.</p>
<p>Today: riding through small-town Florida on an electric scooter with brother, pausing together at a key lime pie factory for pie (frozen, dipped in chocolate, on a stick), lime soda, limeade, and then strolling the pier, popping into a longboard shop, and <i>very</i> fresh fried seafood (fishermen arrived when we sat down; the proprietor took the catch they'd brought in, fried it, and served it to us) at a roadside kitchen trailer festooned with pirate gear.</p>
<p>Had some good conversations. Did the aforementioned inbox cleaning. It's almost 6am now, though - so it looks like the thing I've chosen to drop tonight is physical rest. Ah well; tradeoff I chose to make. I can manage a day on 2.5 hours of sleep. I've done it... at this point, probably hundreds of times already. </p>
<p>Vacation has, so far, been primarily a question of "so what kind of tired are you going to be today?" (This is an improvement! Being only one kind of tired per day instead of <i>all</i> kinds of tired every day is a big, big difference.)</p>
<p>Bedtime.</p>
