<p>At the last meeting of Dr. Lather's "Cultural Foundations" (aka. "Poststructuralism WHEE") class, we tried to summarize a method for poststructuralism. These are heuristics rather than algorithms; notes on "how to think poststructurally" are akin to notes on "how to write poetry" -- they're always incomplete fragments, but that doesn't mean they're not worth trying.</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;"><strong>Practice <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialogic">dialogic </a>and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflexivity_(social_theory)">reflexive</a> engagement.</strong> You are not monologuing in a vacuum; rather, you are in conversation at all times. This is easy when speaking, but in writing and other media where we're trained to be "<em>The</em> Voice Of Truth" (as opposed to "<em>A</em> Voice of truth," or simply "a voice").<br />
</span></li>
<li><strong>Focus on margins and centers, intersections and crossroads.</strong> What do boundaries, positions relative to them, and deliberate efforts to remake them tell you about the evolution and construction of a culture?</li>
<li><strong>Refuse binaries.</strong> When you read a statement, think about the frame of mind it has been written within and against -- for instance, a paper might set up a "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructivist_epistemology">constructivism </a>vs <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_realism">realism</a>" fight, then have one or the other "win" the debate. Point out those binaries and how they contradict and destabilize each other.</li>
<li><strong>Focus on contradictory understandings. </strong>This is a continuation of #3. The world is tangled and messy; refuse metanarratives and avoid "tidy tales" of the "One Truth," especially when you point out binaries yourself. "Some people see a constructivism vs realism battle, <em>but I see both of them as parts of a whole!</em>" is a binary of your metanarrative vs "the old binary."</li>
<li><strong>Do justice to specificity.</strong> Ground theories in specifics and empirical data. (I <em>want </em>to add "...instead of going straight for the transferable generalization," but having just written #3 and #4, I hesitate.)</li>
<li><strong>Pay attention to layers of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affect_(psychology)">affects </a>as a material force.</strong> In other words, people are embodied beings full of feelings. See what resonates for people as you study something ("Affect studies" is a field focused on this). If your audience resonates with "spirituality" in a way that's academically "improper," honor that, <em>and </em>honor the tension you hold in struggling to convey it to an academic audience. Howard S. Becker advised that if you couldn't write something, you could at least write about <em>why</em> you couldn't write it.</li>
<li><strong>Include the autobiographical in non-leaky ways.</strong> You're a character in the world and in your story, but you're not the diva of it; admit your perspective, but don't spew self-indulgence all over your writing.</li>
<li><strong>Do justice to difference</strong>.  Differences between things, within things, among things -- insert your favorite preposition here. This is a way to start breaking down metanarratives and start letting in multivocality.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is hard. In fact, it's impossible. My writing of #1 already violates #3 and #4 ("monologuing in a vacuum" vs being "in conversation at all times" is a tidy tale). #3 and #4 contradict themselves ("refuse binaries" sets up a "binaries" vs "not-binaries" binary). But we try anyway -- the note on #5 is an attempt to use #1 in recognition of a violation of #3 and #4.</p>
