<p>I've progressed to the point in speech therapy where I'm allowed to practice sounds at home (meaning I'm able to make them correctly with enough consistency that i won't mess myself up by practicing the wrong things). They gave me lists of words with sounds that I'm working on, but <i>cat /usr/share/dict/american-english | grep er$ &gt; practice.txt*</i> (and similar commands with more complicated regexps) yield a far more extensive list.</p>
<p>Speech therapy may be my biggest motivation yet to learn regular expressions <i>really</i> well.</p>
<p>*"Look at the big dictionary of words on your computer and put all the words that end in -er into a practice.txt file."</p>
<p>Oh. Did I mention how much I love my <a href="http://ilxo.org">team</a>? I love my team. Despite high levels of sheer exhaustion from running a workshop at the Museum of Science and Industry, Tank and Chris drove to Evanston (Nikki and I had gone there earlier for an ILXO community meeting) and the three of them waited in the library for over an hour while I had speech therapy so I wouldn't have to spend 3 hours taking the train and walking back home afterwards.</p>
<p>This week has probably been our best yet. Door after door opening.</p>
<p>I feel like I could fly.</p>
<p>(Addendum: Okay, XS installation is <i>not</i> working, there are too many emails to reply to, and the wifi keeps going down. Whatever. Life is still most excellent stuff.)</p>
