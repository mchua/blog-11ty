<p>Gah. My flakiness-o-meter has been extraordinarily high this week; it's a panic reaction for when I feel overloaded. I'm sorry, guys. Work vacations feel totally different from school vacations - apparently when you get back, other people have been doing things (as opposed to "we all go on break at the same time!") so there's this whole "catch-up" timesink that I hadn't anticipated at all, and it's making me go "WAAUGH!" disproportionally to how big a deal it actually should be.</p>
<p>I'm putting on my jacket now. I'm going to walk out the door. I'm going to do some planning on the train, eat hot soup for lunch, then go out and kick ass. I may consequently be mildly absent from the internets for the day. And I'll probably be writing a lot of apology emails tonight on account of the balls I've dropped in the last 48 hours.</p>
<p>*sigh*</p>
<p>The problem about this "life" thing is that it's one of those games that takes a minute to learn and a lifetime to master, or something.</p>
