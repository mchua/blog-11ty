I'm writing this post with a mixture of excitement and apprehension. Casey Gollan has been working behind the scenes to convert this blog to Jekyll, and if you're reading this... we've succeeded.

It's a pretty major step forward in terms of my web infrastructure, since I've hand-assembled and maintained every bit of my own web presence since... wow. 2004, which is early in my undergraduate career. But my creaking duct-tape HTML and WordPress wasn't holding together for what I wanted any longer, so here's to new things.

Uh... test post. Tests posts should be short. MEL, STOP WRITING THE TEST POST AND POST IT SO WE CAN SEE IF THIS WORKED!
