<p>This is more amusing if you've taken CompArch, and only works if you're running Windows.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to Start > Run and type "debug" (no quotes).</li>
<li>type "d f000:0" (no quotes, and those are zeroes).</li>
<li>hey look, it's a memory hexdump!</li>
<li>now type "u f000:0" (yep - no quotes).</li>
<li>hey look, it's assembly!</li>
<li>You can look at different chunks of memory by changing the numbers you type after the "d" or the "u."</li>
<li>now type "?" (...right, no quotes) and hit enter. Muahahaha.</li>
<li>q is for quit.</li>
</ol>
<p>Okay, so it's not the most exciting thing in the world, but I wasn't aware that interface existed before. The random things you learn when you browse through books (in this case, Essentials of Mechatronics by John Billingsley). Mr. Gutenberg, I don't know what I'd do without you.</p>
<p>When you procrastinate on <span style="font-style: italic;">art homework</span> by sniffing around Windows memory dumps, you know you really need a Thanksgiving break. I'm off to the studio.</p>
