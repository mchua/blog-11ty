<p>Hey, look - the original <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel5/10731/33854/01612161.pdf">paper </a>about Competencies from the start of its implementation! This was also published in an IEEE transactions.</p>
<p>There are great Olin documents all over the place that provide insights into the original design of... well, just about everything - and I feel there should be an archive, a repository, of all these important things. I'm sure they're kept somewhere, but I don't know where.</p>
<p>I'm going to talk to Ann Schaffner about this. If no such thing exists, it will soon.</p>
