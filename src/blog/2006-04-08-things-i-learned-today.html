<ol>
<li>Crumbly fudge cannot be sintered together.</li>
<li>Cream is delicious! (My father was lactose intolerant, so most of the milk in my house was soy, powdered, or at best skim when I was a kid.)</li>
<li>Old buildings in Boston are gorgeous on the inside. The Somervillains and I went into the Gamble Mansion on Commonwealth Ave. in the wee hours of Saturday to storyboard for our 48 hour film competition entry, and mmm, ballrooms.</li>
<li>(a cup of cream later) Cream is addictive!</li>
</ol>
<p>In other news, I made fudge for the first time today thanks to Beth Sterling's efforts to make me cooking-literate. It's tasty and has to be chiseled out of the pan, hence the resulting crumbles and the sintering comment above.</p>
