<p>Students do not <em>magically </em>know how to work in a studio environment. Asking good questions, knowing when to ask instructors for feedback, figuring out which instructor to ask about what topic, articulating <em>how </em>you need an instructor to help you on a particular topic -- these are all learned skills. My intent in these handouts is to start making them more explicit and to scaffold students into mature studio-learning behavior, very, <em>very </em>fast.</p>
<p>I'm experimenting with making hand-drawn handouts for my college-level teaching. Rich Dionne and Davin Huston have been super-gracious about letting me jump in and help coach teams through the PPI design lab's end-of-term push, and to get myself up to speed on the students -- and vice versa -- I decided to... draw things.</p>
<p>It occurs to me that these sheets may see more general usage in the future, so here's the two-page handout -- it's designed for undergraduate (STEM) studio courses I teach. The first page is a manual on "how to utilize the Mel," including accessibility considerations and a starting list of my skillsets. The second page is a group status check-in document. Feedback/edit-suggestions for future versions is quite welcome. And yes, Olin students, you'll be seeing this sort of thing if you take any of my classes.</p>
