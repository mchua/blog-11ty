<p><em>Part of the QualMIP series, introduced <a href="http://blog.melchua.com/%22http://blog.melchua.com/2016/01/19/qualmip-starting-agreements-fieldwork-focus-grace-weeks-sustainability-and-more/">here</a>.</em></p>
<p>You can tell the semester is ending soon, because my posts are getting terser... this week our studio focus was on three things: project design alignment, creation of a data inventory, and discussion of what "done" means for individual projects.</p>
<p>The week will be spent moving towards whatever "done" is for each person's project -- but having alignment and clarity as to what the project <em>is </em>is an important prerequisite to being able to do that. We spent the day workshopping alignment, with the (draft! handwritten! first version!) worksheet below as representative of how we scaffolded that discussion. (I'd love comments on the worksheet, by the way.)</p>
