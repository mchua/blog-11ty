<p>A friend asked for some pointers towards "engineering identity" materials. Here's what I shared -- this isn't comprehensive, but rather it's material I thought was cool.</p>
<p>From what I've seen, most engineering identity stuff is related to engineering epistemology ("what is engineering, anyway?") and/or underrepresented groups ("how does minority X understand themselves as engineers?".</p>
<p>My favorite "what is engineering, anyway -- and who is an engineer?" instrument is simultaneously adorable and disturbing. It's the Draw-an-engineer test, or the <a href="http://assess.tidee.org/instruments/details/204">DAET.</a> Basically, you get kids -- or anyone, but it's usually kids -- to draw whatever they think an engineer looks like. Afterwards, you analyze the drawings to see what kinds of assumptions they're making: are all the engineer-drawings of white, apparently abled, conventionally-dressed men wearing safety goggles and standing on a train? (Sometimes they are.)</p>
<p>Then there's the space of "how do engineering identities come to be?" Kerry Meyers has explored this space. <a href="http://www.wiete.com.au/journals/GJEE/Publish/vol14no1/16-Myers-K.pdf">Here's a short version of some of her early findings.</a> Among other things, she found that language is a huge deal -- what you call people matters, and it matters from the very beginning. She also describes engineering identity development as a staged developmental process, not a binary "you have no engineering identity... and... BING! Now you magically do!"</p>
<p>Folks have also started to look at how different underrepresented groups (race, gender, class, disability, etc. etc. etc.) construct their engineering identities compared to the dominant group. Here's one <a href="http://www.engr.washington.edu/caee/CAEE_Briefs_PDFs/BeingandBecoming_Chachra_ASEE08.pdf">brief on the gender perspective</a>, but researchers are looking at indigenous students, young black men, and many more.</p>
<p>To my knowledge, very few engineering programs have explicit curricular discussion of students' engineering identities. Smith and UTEP's E-LEAD program are two exceptions with required first-year courses that provide devoted space to the topic. I'd love to see more of this sort of exploration, since developing a personal engineering identity can help students persist in bridging their engineering knowledge into their lives and out to a world that needs it.</p>
