<p>First: I'm working on a list of FOSS hackers who've gone back to school to study FOSS in some way; do you know of any? Please let me know in the comments. They needn't be coders; designers, documenters, etc. are also totally welcome, as are contributors to open content and hardware projects -- for instance, a very active Wikipedian who goes to graduate school to study the collaboration practices of Wikipedia.)</p>
<p>Now then.</p>
<p>Seb Benthall's post about <a href="http://digifesto.com/2012/02/28/another-rant-about-academia-and-open-source/">academic vs open culture</a> reminded me that I'd like to track my fellow FOSS-to-academia migrants somewhere. Seb and myself are members of a fairly short tradition that includes folks like <a href="phd.martin-krafft.net">Martin Krafft</a> (Debian developer to CS/Sociology PhD) and <a href="http://mako.cc">Mako Hill</a> (Debian developer and Ubuntu hacker to interdisciplinary PhD student and Berkman Center researcher).</p>
<p>If you think about it, there's no way the tradition can be anything like short. Undergraduate degrees tend to focus on "study to be able to do" for a broad area rather than a more focused "study of" a particular topic, so I'm mainly looking at grad students and those who've gotten their graduate degrees. To enter graduate school, you typically need an undergraduate degree -- which means you're likely at least in your early twenties. That's how old the Free Software and Open Source movements are themselves.</p>
<p>It's not that we're the first generation of grad students to grow up in FOSS culture -- that distinction belongs to people now in their mid-thirties to early forties, who were college-aged in the mid-90's when the FOSS world was ramping up for the firs time. But we're the first ones to enter grad school at a time when FOSS culture was widespread enough to be considered a legitimate topic of study by open-minded advisors; in a prior day, we might have studied CS, math, education, or any number of things with "proper" topics as our primary research focus, with open source remaining a devoted side hobby mostly separate from our "real academic work."</p>
<p>It's a good time and place in history to be. Plenty of opportunities to find and make -- and we're hackers, so we're used to finding and making our own way through a chaotic world. Perfect.</p>
