<p>Olin alumni reunion: as much as I am not a bar/party/large-crowds-of-people-with-alcohol person, being with my old school buddies, in any context, is much like pulling on a favorite old sweater. Everyone is doing great - I didn't expect Laura to fly in from Abu Dhabi, nor Beth to come from Vancouver, and so forth - Cody came from California, I hadn't seen him since we graduated 3 years ago, Chandra and I made lunch plans, I'm cashing in my rain check on Karen and Krystin's housewarming party and going to bring them a moving-out bottle of wine (whoops), Boris is more freaked out by the news of Andy P's engagement than I am, DJ discovered climbing trees by his house that I now have to come out and try, and so on through the night. (Well... I lasted an hour, and then I was just <em>tired</em>.)</p>
<p>Probably the most frequent question I got tonight was "so,<em> where</em> are you living now?" It was easy to tell how long it'd been since I talked with the person from where they thought I was - everywhere from China to Virginia (I think this was a mistaken "Washington DC") to pre-emptive hesitant "Raleigh?" queries and a few folks who have already given up keeping track. I explained I was with Red Hat and open source and getting people excited about education for a living, and they laughed and said it sounded like a Mel job.</p>
<p>Hung out with Hari in Harvard Square and yelled at him to get off his ass and start Doing Stuff (which... has been a recurring theme in conversations with at least a half-dozen of my friends in the past 2 weeks - maybe this is part of my role in life, to kick my friends into <em>doing stuff</em>). It was quite good. He lent me an Econ book which I shall read tomorrow morning, plus a business book which I will read... ah, probably tomorrow too. They won't take long.</p>
<p>Finally left Harvard Square at 11:30pm, intermittently half-dozing on the train rides back out to the suburbs. When I'm tired, I'll do this thing on airplanes and public transit where I stuff my hands into opposite sleeves (like crossing your arms, except inside your sleeves) and lean over onto the nearest stable surface - train wall, bus seat, airplane-boarding-tunnel-thing - and close my eyes while I wait for a moment and rest. I'm still awake, just... in suspend mode, I suppose. It's usually only for a couple seconds at a time.</p>
<p>Walked 2 miles back from the train station, made it in at 1:30AM, and my feet hurt. Sitting here eating a late-night dinner and trying to rub them out and let them rest a little before I try to sleep, because they are sufficiently sore to be a distraction to unconsciousness, even in my current state of tiredness. I think I shall be nice to them tomorrow. And consider wearing shoes with arch supports next time I go dancing (it's the combination of Friday dancing and tonight's walk that are bothersome, I'm pretty sure).</p>
<p>I'm back in Boston for a couple days, and the view between Kendall and Charles/MGH on the Red Line is as gorgeous as it ever was; I've always loved going over the Longfellow bridge and looking at the Charles River and the city and the lights. I'm pretty sure it's time to leave, though; I'm here, I'm with my friends, I'm happy, hanging out with them is awesome, I just landed back in town today for gosh sakes - and already I'm restless again. Oh well. There are worse things than wanderlust, and it does take you to some interesting places.</p>
<p>My feet are probably ok now. Going to bed.</p>
