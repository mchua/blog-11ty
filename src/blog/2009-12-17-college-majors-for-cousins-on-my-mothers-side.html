<p>That's it so far, in order of age as best as I can remember. I'm the oldest. #3 is my brother Jason; the rest are also girls. I don't know how this happened, but oh, it makes me happy. And not just for the reasons you might immediately think - there are years and years and generations of context behind this that... well, the short version is just that it makes me <i>happy</i>, that's all. No expectations, no cheering, no pressure&nbsp; - just a quiet moment and a nod.</p>
<p>The world changes, a little bit at a time.</p>
