<p>This idea isn't mine; it's something that, to the best of my ability, surfaced from a conversation between Addi Berry and Emma Jane Hogbin at Ontario LinuxFest in October 2009. But it's kept cropping up in my mind, itching for someone to <em>do</em> something with it...</p>
<p>What if someone wrote a travel guide for an open source project? Imagine a guideÂ  - say, <em>The Wandering Hacker's Guide to Fedora</em> (or sub in any open source project of your choice) - with a table of contents that looked like this (loosely based on <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Thailand">Wikitravel Thailand</a>):</p>
<p><strong>1. Understanding Fedora</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>History of Fedora</li>
<li>The Peoples of Fedora</li>
<li>Governance: FESCo, FAmSCo, and the Board</li>
<li>Culture - hot dogs, pandas, and the four foundations</li>
<li>Calendar - major release milestones</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Regions of Fedora<br />
</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Teams</li>
<li>Geographic regions</li>
<li>SIGs</li>
<li>Important pages and mailing lists</li>
<li>Key conferences and in-person gatherings (FUDCons, FADs)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Getting Started</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>As a user: installing Fedora</li>
<li>As a tinkerer: learning tips and tweaks and helping with basic support</li>
<li>As an ambassador: doing outreach for Fedora</li>
<li>As an upstream developer: making your project work with Fedora</li>
<li>As a member of a Fedora team: joining Infrastructure, Marketing, Design, QA, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Getting Around</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Making your accounts</li>
<li>Common communication media (lists, wiki, IRC, identi.ca, etc)</li>
<li>Finding information about people</li>
<li>Finding information about packages</li>
<li>Finding information about processes</li>
<li>IRC meeting etiquette</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Things to see and do</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Host a release party</li>
<li>Vote in elections</li>
<li>Join a Test Day</li>
<li>Attend FUDCon and FADs</li>
<li>Try an Alpha release</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6. Studying and working in Fedora<br />
</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Incorporating Fedora into class assignments</li>
<li>Fedora spins for various disciplines (security, design, etc.)</li>
<li>Fedora for RHEL/CentOS sysadmins</li>
<li>Using Fedora at work</li>
<li>Companies that hire people to work on Fedora</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Staying polite and safe</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Etiquette</li>
<li>The basics of keeping your Fedora installation secure</li>
<li>What to do if you meet a jerk</li>
<li>Gender, race, age, minority, etc. issues</li>
<li>Ways to show respect</li>
<li>Dress and conduct at in-person events</li>
<li>Don't get offended if...</li>
<li>How to give constructive feedback and get it implemented</li>
</ul>
<p>Would this be useful to you? To your students? Would it have been useful to you when you started? What's missing? How could we get this written?</p>
<p>If anyone wants to take this on as a project, I'd be willing to mentor - it's a good opportunity to learn about writing, open source culture, and possibly even a bit of instructional design (which I'm not an expert in - we'd find someone to look at it when you have a draft).</p>
