<p>In other news, I also figured out why I was so tired today when I went down for what was supposed to be an (already uncharacteristic) 2-hour nap and woke up 2 hours later to find that my ability to speak had been replaced by a fever. Adrenaline sometimes makes me more functional than I should be.</p>
<p>I went back to sleep for another 5 hours and then woke up to take care of some things I needed to get done today. I've done them all except for two, so I am going to do those two things now, ignore <i>everything else</i>, and get another couple hours of sleep before the next day starts. I'm actually extremely functional - I just need lots of sleep right now, so I'm going to try budgeting <i>actual</i> 8-hour workdays for the rest of the week (a weird concept that I've never actually voluntarily tried).</p>
<p>The next few days (assuming my immune system takes as much time to recover as I expect) may be an educational exercise in prioritization; Greg reminded me of the difference between "urgent" and "important" today, and I <i>have </i>been spending too much time on the first and not enough time on the second. It's not enough to <i>do</i> things; I have to do the <i>right</i> things, since I very well can't do everything. I did a great job of prioritization last year when I was sidelined with RSI; I need to learn how to do it when I'm <i>not</i> sick or injured.</p>
<p>Let us try this. I can do this for 3 days, right?</p>
<p>Right?</p>
