<p>Freedom. It's an important word, with many clashing choruses of interpretations. I have been thinking about freedom lately through my music and my movements through it.</p>
<p>I feel free in one sense when I nosh on the amazing fish n' chips n' beer at the small Irish pub that's down the road. I feel free when I stay out late, eat triple dark chocolate ice cream, lounge in bed. I don't discount or dismiss these experiences; they're wonderful; I do them with great relish and with full appreciation.<em><br />
</em></p>
<p>But I feel free in a different sense -- I'd even say a deeper sense, although I am still timid using the language of value judgments here -- when I am gasping, sweating, running in the morning when I'd <em>really </em>rather be in bed and feel like <em>crap </em>and <em>really </em>want that ice cream and missed a movie last night because I went to bed early so I could get up and hit the gym. When I grit my teeth and step painstakingly through scales my fingers have forgotten on the piano, when I slow my playing tempo to pay attention to each -- individual -- phrase -- instead of letting the new sonata fling as fast as it can go. When my legs start wobbling in grand plié but I <em>stay </em>there and <em>watch </em>my knees and <em>hold </em>it, hold alignment.</p>
<p>Because I have the joy of mastery and growth of self then; not a beating-into-submission, but a setting-free to follow better impulses, to improvise more fully in the moment.</p>
<p>Because my legs grow lighter and lighter in the running, and strong and stable, and can leap benches and swing from lampposts and I can just <em>decide </em>to spring to the floor and leap up and yelp with joy <em>because </em>it feels good and I <em>want </em>to. And the music spins out through my hands and I can twist the phrases wry or lyrical or maelstroming, no gap between my orchestral imagination and the real sound, hardly a gap between the dreaming and the doing. And I stand straighter in the dance studio mirror, and I smile and think: <em>I look tall. </em>And: <em>it's easy.</em></p>
<p>I know the scientific words for much of what's going on. I know the myelin is wrapping through the cortex of my brain, the musical phrases chunking, the muscle fibers tearing and rebuilding. I know it's both me and not-me reshaping who I am; the healing, growing powers that the universe is saturated in, the free will we are granted through a gift of love, my choice to use that will to become... me. It's not that I was not myself before, or that I was inadequate; it never was. But we are always in the process of becoming.</p>
<p>All these examples are from physicality, from things my body does -- I know it happens in my mind and heart and soul as well; I want it to be <em>easy </em>to be good, <em>easy </em>to do right. But oh, the discipline is hard, if you would have something be easy!</p>
<p>But that is the freedom I would go for, and the freedom I would have and share. The hard is what makes it good, because the hard is what makes it easy. The freedom to be good and right and <em>you, </em>to fluently and fully express that as the calling strikes you. And the <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/11-30.htm">yoke is easy, and the burden is light</a>, and both are soaked in sweat and tears... which are what make the feeling of refreshing coolness when the wind blows.</p>
<p>Yep. Freedom is important to me. And I want to keep on learning how to chase it better.</p>
