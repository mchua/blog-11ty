<p>Things that help me be myself:</p>
<ul>
<li>Writing.</li>
<li>Walking - wandering spontaneously through a city and feeling confident striding through known or unknown spaces.</li>
<li>Being with people who know me as I am and want to be, and who let me be myself around them, without comment or pressure.</li>
<li>The mindful preparation and consumption of extremely good tea and/or fresh food. Preferably with aforementioned company, particularly lovely when followed by one of those aforementioned walks, reflected on with the aforementioned writing, and rested-from with a peaceful nap.</li>
<li>Creating good things.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm pouring this out through my keyboard and watching myself come together again. I think I <i>will</i> do a bit of Inkscape now, and then lie down and close my eyes.</p>
