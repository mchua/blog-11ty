<p>Great - I just spent the entire night being frustrated about how I had to stay up all night in order to get uninterrupted productivity time, and thus half the productivity time wasn't actually productive. I love my family, I do. It's just... I haven't found a way to resolve the compatibility issues between the world I was born into and the one I want to <em>make</em>. Every time I think I have, I haven't.</p>
<p>Sometimes it works and I can pull the two together, and this happens more and more, and that's real nice. And then sometimes I have to choose one to run towards and one to run away from, and... well, I've made the choice which one to go for when I have to choose. I can usually be a daughter and a Mel at the same time. And then sometimes I'm... a Mel.</p>
<p>Today: world-bridging FAIL.</p>
<p>Tomorrow: another chance to dance the balance right.</p>
<p>Right now I nap for an hour (yeah, it'll be enough sleep; I'll take another nap at lunch) and then I get into my car (yay car!) and do a first sprint from the hills. I wanted my piano tonight, but people were sleeping, and playing piano was what triggered the FAIL in the first place.</p>
<p>Frustration is okay. But sleep is good now. And I'll figure out a way to be both here <em>and</em> me at the same time when I wake up. We're just going to try again tomorrow.</p>
