<p>One thing that took me a surprisingly long time to figure out is that just because something is published academic literature doesn't mean it's well-written, nor rigorously designed or thought-through, and it does not mean it contains a <em>staggering intellectual breakthrough!!!</em> only accessible to Very Smart People who Study the Paper Closely.</p>
<p>I suspected this foggily as an undergrad, but didn't really believe it until a year or so past graduation when I'd read more scholarly papers, timidly went up to one of my former professors, and said "look, I've been looking through this &lt;publication whose name will remain anonymous&gt; and I just <em>don't get</em> what they discovered, it sounds like these studies just did a couple random things and came up with mediocre conclusions and I think they could have been better-designed but I'm guessing there's something I'm missing." (Not verbatim, but you get the idea.)</p>
<p><em>Well, of course!</em> was the prof's reaction. Stunned, I repeated this experiment with multiple professors. Results held. It was not that I hadn't been "smart enough" to "understand" the papers - it was that the papers didn't have much worth understanding.</p>
<p>I've tried to question "academic mystique" ever since. Where does this "academic credibility" the rest of the world looks at and goes <em>oooo, shiny! we believe you, because you have a PhD!</em> come from? Is it masked by long processes and fancy-sounding words and good-looking LaTeX templates more often than it should be?</p>
