<p dir="ltr">Another set of parody lyrics from the <a href="http://blog.melchua.com/2018/11/13/students-assign-me-homework-fall-2018-edition/">challenge by my first-year students</a>; if you like this, you may also enjoy <a href="http://blog.melchua.com/2018/12/03/open-science-songs-do-you-hear-the-people-sing/">the Les Miz parody song</a> that preceded it. Thanks to Shauna Gordon-McKeon for lyrics co-authorship!</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Sign This Publishing Plan (to the tune of "Take Me Or Leave Me" from Rent)</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>Context: a graduate [Student] has a rather well-done paper, and is excited about getting it to the widest audience possible. However, their [Advisor] is concerned that jumping to the first open access journal they’ve found might not be the best publishing plan.</em></p>
<p>[Student:]<br />
Every single day,<br />
People I never meet<br />
They email me and say "thanks, your dataset's sweet!"<br />
Ever since I made it free<br />
Everyone's citing me<br />
CC-BY, I can't help it baby</p>
<p>So be kind, and don't lose your mind<br />
Just remember my h-index helps you too, baby</p>
<p>Sign this publishing plan<br />
All knowledge should be free<br />
So if you give a damn<br />
Sign this baby or leave me</p>
<p>Sign this baby or leave me</p>
<p>A single paywalled page<br />
Can never see the sun<br />
This paper needs a stage baby, why not this one<br />
This journal made the news<br />
So I guess that's what I'll choose<br />
Is it legitimate? Maybe.</p>
<p>But it's fine - please don't waste my time<br />
It's the internet age, it's not 1980</p>
<p>Sign this publishing plan<br />
All knowledge should be free<br />
So if you give a damn<br />
Sign this baby or leave me</p>
<p>Okay, so the fees cost a lot<br />
But hey, can we give this a shot?<br />
Oh, don't fight, don't lose your head<br />
You want them to cite Smith instead?<br />
Who?<br />
Who should they cite instead?<br />
[Spoken:] C'mon, just let me publish there.</p>
<p>[Advisor:]<br />
It won't work<br />
I look before I leap<br />
I'm well known in our discipline<br />
The risk here is just too steep baby<br />
It's just... thin.<br />
I've read Their procedure through<br />
This is not peer review<br />
It's just too good to be true, baby<br />
So be wise, and prioritize<br />
This could go anywhere, so don't compromise<br />
You're one lucky baby</p>
<p>[Advisor:] Take me for what I am<br />
[Student:] A control freak.<br />
[Advisor:] I'm just trying to be<br />
[Student:] A good advisor, I know<br />
[Advisor:] And if you give a damn<br />
[Student:] I graduate next week!<br />
[Advisor:] Take it baby, or leave me<br />
[Student:] I already sent it, so -</p>
<p>[Both:] That's it!<br />
[Advisor:] You want the tenure track?<br />
[Both:] I quit!<br />
[Advisor:] Tell them to send it back<br />
[Student:] Publishers! What is it about them?<br />
[Both:] Can't live with them or without them!</p>
<p>(Chorus, overlapping)<br />
[Advisor:] This is not a good plan<br />
[Student:] Sign this publishing plan<br />
[Advisor:] Your labor is not free<br />
[Student:] Knowledge wants to be free<br />
[Advisor:] And if you give a damn you'd better<br />
[Student:] And if you give a damn<br />
[Advisor:] Change this, baby<br />
[Student:] Sign this, baby<br />
[Advisor:] Change this, baby<br />
[Student:] Sign this, baby<br />
[Advisor:] Change this, baby<br />
[Student:] Sign this, baby<br />
[Both:] Or leave me</p>
<p>[Both, spoken:] Guess I'm leaving. I'm gone!</p>
