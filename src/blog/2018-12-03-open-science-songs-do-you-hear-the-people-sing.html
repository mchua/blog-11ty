<p dir="ltr">By popular demand, I'm publishing the parody lyrics I wrote (and performed this week, with the help of my first-year honors class). The <a href="http://blog.melchua.com/2018/11/13/students-assign-me-homework-fall-2018-edition/">challenge, set by students</a>, was to create a musical presentation about open science/open data as part of our discussion on social justice in the STEM fields. Also see <a href="http://blog.melchua.com/2018/12/03/open-science-songs-sign-this-publishing-plan/">"Sign This Publishing Plan,"</a> the other song performed that day.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Do you hear the people sing? (to the tune of the Les Miserables song of the same name)</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>Context: In 2015, the NSF <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2016/nsf16009/nsf16009.jsp#q1">came out with a public access policy</a>.</em> This<em> song is set… shortly before that. </em></p>
<p dir="ltr">[Taxpayer:]<br />
Do you hear the people sing?<br />
Singing the song of angry men?<br />
It is the music of the people<br />
Who have funded you again!</p>
<p>All the work that we support<br />
After the process for review<br />
Within a year of the report<br />
We should see it too</p>
<p>[NSF officer:]<br />
Will you join in our crusade?<br />
Who will be strong and stand with me?<br />
Disseminating research<br />
Will ensure prosperity</p>
<p>[Open science advocate:]<br />
Then join in the fight<br />
That will give it the right to be free!</p>
<p>[All:]<br />
Do you hear the people sing?<br />
Singing the song of angry men?<br />
It is the music of the people<br />
Who have funded you again!</p>
<p>All the work that we support<br />

<p>[Open science advocate:]<br />
Will you advocate to Congress<br />
So our banner may advance?<br />
If the NSF commits to this,<br />
We have a happy chance</p>
<p>To open your work will<br />
Become a requirement of grants</p>
<p>[All:]<br />
