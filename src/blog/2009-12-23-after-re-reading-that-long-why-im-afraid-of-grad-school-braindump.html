<p>It really boils down to this, doesn't it?</p>
<blockquote><p>And my heart says yes.</p>
<p>And then it goes into all sorts of disclaimers about the lack of certainty and citations and concrete evidence to back up that yes. But it says yes, regardless.</p></blockquote>
<p>We're all set free by others who can't have those freedoms, and if we're strong enough, we will in turn give other people liberties, some of which we'll never have ourselves.</p>
<p>And I'm <i>totally</i> cheering myself on with that [insert colorful adjective phrase] Statement of Purpose right now. Come on, you can do it. Keep unblocking yourself. With lots of help from other folks as needed. Keep on going.</p>
