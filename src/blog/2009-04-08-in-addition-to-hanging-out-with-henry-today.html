<p>I have health insurance, and my taxes will be totally filed tomorrow after I pay BoA $6 to make me out a bank check. Yeah, I ordered checks too... I've just never needed paper ones enough before, but it's becoming a more frequent occurrence now. Somehow I feel like a more competent adult now that those two are taken care of.</p>
<p>Next project is a clean apartment. Chris is pretty much done moving out, and now the apartment has no furniture except my bed, folding chairs, and a couch (yep... tables, not so much) and an empty bedroom with a hardwood floor and an actual paint job, as my room looks like someone rubbed white-out on the walls and carpet with newsprint for about 10 minutes before giving up.</p>
<p>I'm continuing to steadily read through my piles of books since I'm determined to reduce them by 50% before I move. Or fit them in one bookshelf, anyway. There will be some tough partings coming up... I'll be much freer afterwards.</p>
<p>Oh, yes. And the job thing. Working on that one too. ;) The laptop-at-pika experiment has worked out quite well; I think I should be able to trust myself after this weekend to take it home a day or two a week as needed. Possibly. My fingers don't hurt sooner or more, I think - but I am more conscious of them hurting sooner (lower threshold of pain awareness... but not tolerance, mind you!) and more conscious of my posture and the way I use my muscles to type, so... awesome.</p>
<p>Things I may get, if budgeting allows (though I'm trying like heck not to spend money, basically): a scanner/printer/copier, speakers, a microsoft natural keyboard, a cheap big folding table. Tables are... kind of important, I've learned after several days of eating off chairs while squatting on the ground.</p>
<p>My OSS community work has mostly slowed to a standstill due to lack of ability to go on IRC and respond to emails. This blog is most of what I type on, by way of trying to let people know why I'm not typing other things (and also for me to sort my mind out a bit). I miss it, and can't wait to get back to it - though I also think this sabbatical of sorts is great for my growth, since I have to constantly explain "what I do*" to people who aren't already in the OSS world.</p>
<p>*when not injured</p>
<p>Message backlog is piling up. That's okay. I'm also learning to deal with my perfectionism effectively. ;) And this makes me appreciate the ability to get in touch with people so much more - I did take it for granted.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>Ok. The distal side of my right hand, wrist, and forearm disagree with me today. Signing off.</p>
