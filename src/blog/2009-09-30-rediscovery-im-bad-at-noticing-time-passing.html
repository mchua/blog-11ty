<p>Fortunately, I have a rental car right now, so I can follow my family to dinner... just... uh... an hour 15 minutes late.</p>
<p>It's a dinner party anyway, and one formal enough that I have to dress up for it, and... well, you know how I feel about such things already. But the procrastination, it can haz productiveness! In the interim, I managed to (among many, many other things) <a href="http://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/logistics/2009-September/000253.html">unblock or partially-unblock a bunch of zikula package reviews...</a> I seriously did not notice it had gotten this late. I thought I might be, I dunno, 15 minutes late. 30, at most.</p>
<p>...I should leave before they get unhappy (or run out of food). Sigh. Where's that shirt Mom wants me to wear?</p>
