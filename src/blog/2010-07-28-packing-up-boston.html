<p>As restless as I tend to be, it's still harder than I'd like to admit to leave a place behind. Technically, I should be past New York by now; I was supposed to meet up with an old teacher and a friend in New Hampshire this morning, then start the drive to Raleigh. They had to cancel, so I decided to spend the early morning resting and packing instead, more leisurely - and found that once I sat down and looked around... there was a lot I didn't want to just rip away and leave behind. Packing, usually a hurried 30-minute affair of shoving things haphazardly into bags, turned into a more methodical slow pick through all the things I'm leaving behind.</p>
<p>I'll have one last shot to bring some of it back on my second trip to Raleigh, but I find myself mentally triaging again - do I <i>want</i> to keep my high school math notes? Yes and no. How much do I need? Not much. How much do I have? More than I need. How much do I want? I... have no idea. Part of me wants to settle down and have a place stable enough to get a <i>real</i> piano, even a beat-up old upright like Hector (which I got for free my freshman year of college), stock the fridge with more food than I can eat in a week and not have to wonder if it'll spoil while I'm away. Part of me wants a carry-on luggage, a laptop backpack, and a travel guitar, and... that's it. I am young and stupid, and so the second part is bigger, stronger, faster, and wins out every time. </p>
<p>I have generally made it a policy not to regret any decisions (nor to make decisions I'll regret), so it's not a problem. I'll be hopping around for work and school and stuff anyway - all these things I've waited my entire life to do - and I do love seeing the world. I still get dizzy with the prospect of all that unexpected freedom (it's still unexpected, even after a year or three or seven or ten depending on when you start counting), and I don't think that's going to go away anytime soon.</p>
<p>And my bass and guitar and Ian's electric mandolin and my last two suitcases (one for clothes, one for everything else) aren't yet in the car. What am I doing? I should put things in the bags, put bags in the car, and hit the road. I love night driving; it's quiet, peaceful, and requires a working rear license plate light (yeah, going to fix that shortly).</p>
<p>Quiet night, open road, long stretches of highway and thinking. My mind will settle down again once I'm behind the wheel. </p>
