<p>Kicked off a couple things this weekend. First, family reunion -- I am <i>incredibly</i><br />
proud of my cousins, who are rallying to get the Lim clan in the same<br />
place at the same time for the first time in... oh geez, over a decade.<br />
Lim family reunions aren't trivial; imagine 8 sisters and all their<br />
husbands and kids spread out across multiple cities -- every timezone in<br />
the (mainland) USA, China, and the Philippines. Last time this<br />
happened, we were all little kids; some of us weren't even born. This<br />
time around, we're using our fluency in electronic collaboration (my<br />
brother is apparently a spreadsheet-scripting ninja; my cousin Megan and<br />
I co-drafted an email on Etherpad last night) to get things together,<br />
even if it means <i>hunting down our moms.</i></p>
<p>In Seattle, Mindy<br />
(Northwestern University, engineering) pointed out that our generation<br />
had an unusually high proportion of geeks. I've noted this before, but<br />
it is true; out of 14 kids, we have an electrical engineer, 2<br />
mechanicals, 1 bio, 2 chemists, 1 industrial designer, 1 economist, and<br />
at least another in the pipeline who's not yet in college but is<br />
planning on the engineering thing as well. (And now I wait for one of my<br />
cousins to go declare a theatre or French major and break the trend --<br />
but that would be cool as well, because there are so many different<br />
kinds of geekiness; everyone's intensely interested in <i>something.</i>)</p>
<p>Anyway.<br />
The second bit of plot I set in motion was an email sent out to the<br />
other incoming grad students in my department, which went roughly like<br />
this:

way around new places by getting lost in advance. I figured it might be<br />
a good idea to do so before I actually had to be anywhere, and wondered<br />
if anyone might want to come along...</span> Join<br />
the Lunch N' Lost brigade, armed with cell phones and campus maps and a<br />
sense of shamelessness about asking questions, and we will:</div>

<p>Before Sebastian headed out to Vancouver for LinuxCon, I revealed to him that this was actually part of my Devious Master Plan to start a panda meme within Purdue Engineering. But sssh, don't tell anyone, it's a <i>secret</i>.</p>
<p><i>Bwa ha ha ha! (bamboo-munching noises here)</i></div>
