<p>Ever get the notion that you've shut yourself down somehow because if you felt, you'd feel entirely too much?</p>
<p>Enter Wordsworth's "The World Is Too Much With Us."<span style="font-style: italic;"></p>
<p>The world is too much with us; late and soon,</span><br /><span style="font-style: italic;"> Getting and spending, we lay waste our powers:</span><br /><span style="font-style: italic;"> Little we see in Nature that is ours;</span><br /><span style="font-style: italic;"> We have given our hearts away, a sordid boon!</span><br /><span style="font-style: italic;"> This Sea that bares her bosom to the moon;</span><br /><span style="font-style: italic;"> The winds that will be howling at all hours,</span><br /><span style="font-style: italic;"> And are up-gathered now like sleeping flowers;</span><br /><span style="font-style: italic;"> For this, for everything, we are out of tune,</span><br /><span style="font-style: italic;"> It moves us not.--Great God! I'd rather be</span><br /><span style="font-style: italic;"> A Pagan suckled in a creed outworn;</span><br /><span style="font-style: italic;"> So might I, standing on this pleasant lea,</span><br /><span style="font-style: italic;"> Have glimpses that would make me less forlorn;</span><br /><span style="font-style: italic;"> Have sight of Proteus rising from the sea;</span><br /><span style="font-style: italic;"> Or hear old Triton blow his wreathed horn.<br /></span></p>
