<p>I've had some quiet celebrations of reversing long-held chunks of identity over the past few months. Recently: language-learning, singing, motherhood (yeah, <em>that </em>wasÂ <em>weird.</em>) The last one was last weekend at late Friday night Chicago blues with Andrew (where we failed the Olin challenge with Elsa and Harold).</p>
<p>"Are you a dance minor?" asks the panting, grinning (<em>excellent</em>) strange lead who's just swirled me through a delicious, frenzied tangle on the wooden floor. Blues music starts to pour again; I have no idea how long we'd been dancing.</p>
<p>"Excuse me?" I manage to gasp between intakes of oxygen.</p>
<p>"A dance minor," he repeats. "Or something. You've had training. Most people can't keep up with anything like that; you're really flexible. It was a compliment."</p>
<p>"Thanks -- I'm not actually -- but thank you," I stammer, ducking out of the way of swirling couples. And he's gone, off to another dance, and so am I. Probably just being polite, I tell myself. "Flexible" is not often a word used to describe me. But two leads later, another gentleman: "Whoa, what other styles do you <em>do</em>? Are you a dance minor?" And so the compliments continued through the night.</p>
<p>WIN: I am a mover! The awkward, unathletic kid who wished she could be a disembodied brain-in-jar (it'd be much more convenient) grew up into a young woman increasingly comfortable and present in her body.</p>
