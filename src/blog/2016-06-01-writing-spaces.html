<p><em>Part of the continuing adventures of Mel learning how to be an ADHD academic.</em></p>
<p>One very important thing I have learned and verified experimentally: when I write, I need to be in a writing place. For me, this means the coffeeshop around the corner, the coworking space inside my gym, or the Cambridge Public Library.</p>
<p>The point of the writing place is to increase the effort it takes for me to stop writing. If I'm at home, the effort I need to stop writing is simply... to stop writing and putter off somewhere else -- the couch, my bed, whatever. If I'm at the coffeeshop, however, I have to pack up, walk home... that's harder. I'm more likely to keep writing.</p>
<p>So: no writing from my house. (Bonus: I also have to stop working and go home and sleep at some point, because all the places I've listed close at 11:30pm at latest.)</p>
<p>My office also doesn't work, because I do too many small administrative things inside my office to associate it with deep writing thought -- although I do write well from other places on the Olin campus!</p>
<p>The one exception to this is that I can write from anywhere -- including my house and office -- if I am writing with someone else. If someone else is physically in the space with me and keeping me accountable to writing, I can be writing anything (and they can be doing anything) and I will be able to write. If they are not physically in the space with me but we are virtually collaborating on the same piece of writing, I can similarly write from anywhere.However, if I have a virtual accountability buddy, and we are not working on the same thing, then I have to go to a writing place.</p>

<p>I like my writing places. At first, I thought they felt wasteful -- but now I see them as infrastructure and investment, and they're also beautiful places; one has great coffee (wonderful for ADHD focus), one has spaces where I can run around and lift heavy things and climb on other things (wonderful for ADHD focus), and one is beautiful and home to many wonderful books (okay, maybe not that great for ADHD focus, but it makes for a very happy Mel).</p>
