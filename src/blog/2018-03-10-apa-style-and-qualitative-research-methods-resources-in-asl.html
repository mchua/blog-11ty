<p>My friend Anna Murphy recently sent me <a href="http://library.stkate.edu/citing-writing/apa">St. Catherine University's library resources on APA style</a> -- and they have ASL versions! Actual ASL with nice translations, not "we signed the English word for word" versions. I think these are a nice high school or early-college intro for ASL users, maybe good for a first-year college seminar course. (I'll ask Corrine Occhino about using them for ours, since this is a lovely set of matched bilingual resources.)</p>

<p>Joan Naturale also pointed me to an <a href="http://aslchoice.com/reep">ASL companion to an introductory qualitative research methods textbook</a> (Research and Evaluation in Education and Psychology (REEP): Integrating diversity with quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods). "ASL Companion," in this case, means there are well-done chapter summaries in ASL with the blessing of the original author (Dr. Donna Mertens). This is a <em>nice</em> textbook, in its 4th edition from Sage, not some hastily cobbled together thing for the sake of having something signed. Good scholarship in good ASL is, sadly, scarce stuff.</p>
<p>This stuff is important; not only does it make these materials more accessible to those who are native users of ASL, it gives us a glimpse towards what <em>scholarship in ASL </em>might look like. And yes, there have been Deaf (and hearing!) researchers working on "academic ASL" for a while (and what that means is still up for debate). I'm new to the conversation and feeling my way into a world that people far smarter and wiser (and familiar with ASL and Deaf culture!) have created before me, with the hopes of contributing to it as well.<em><br />
</em></p>
<p>My question is: what would it look like to do this in engineering, computing, and in engineering/computing education? I've seen scholarship <em>in </em>ASL, but only for clearly ASL/Deafness related fields... signed linguistics, Deaf education, Deaf history and rights, and so on. I've seen stuff <em>about </em>ASL in other fields, but it was written in English. What does it look like to do engineering and computing work in ASL and/or in a culturally Deaf manner? What would culturally Deaf engineering <em>look like</em>?</p>
<p>And I'm pretty sure that <em>look </em>is a key operative word here, but it's also going to <em>sound</em> <em>like</em> something -- Deafness doesn't mean the absence of auditory information! -- and it's also going to <em>be</em> a host of other things, because Deafness isn't just about visuals; consider the DeafBlind community, consider all the tactile/kinesthetic richness of the world, consider -- but I digress.</p>
<p>But what will Deaf Engineering (and Computing) <em>be</em> like? I don't know. I'm aware that I'm continuing to write these blog posts in English, and I'm okay with that right now, so long as my actual published/presented outcomes on this front come out bilingually. In part I'm writing in English because this is my scribble pad and I'm a native English writer, and it's what my thoughts come out most fluidly in (if I thought best in Spanish, I'd be writing in Spanish). But these kinds of resources are not just examples and resources for my future students; they're building blocks for me of what might be, what things might look like. And I can also tell from watching them that they took <em>tremendous</em> amounts of work to create, so...</p>
<p>..examples. I leave them here as exercises for the reader.</p>
