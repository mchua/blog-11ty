<p>Back from vacation. Just staggered (literally) back into my apartment in Raleigh a few minutes ago. My brain is approximately like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>But Sam turned to Bywater, and so came back up the Hill, as day was ending once more. And he went on, and there was yellow light, and fire within... He drew a deep breath. "Well, I'm back," he said. <i>--Last lines of The Lord of the Rings, Chapter 'The Grey Havens'.</i></p></blockquote>
<p>It's hard to imagine unless you've read the books (or seen the films), but that's the best thought-picture I can paint at the moment. I'm feeling surprisingly well-rested and... good. Very good. The tiredness is a temporary local thing that comes from having driven down from Boston in 36 hours, and I'm actually paying heed to it right now and going to sleep <i>extremely</i> early. More coherence when I wake up.</p>
<p>I'll start replying to emails tomorrow.</p>
