<p>I will be in Washington DC from approximately 5:30pm on Friday, May 23rd to 11:30am on Sunday, May 25. Mostly I'll be at the May version of <a href="http://olpclearningclub.org/meetings/march-meeting-at-gallaudet-university/">this</a>, the OLPC meetup at Gallaudet - gotta un-rustify my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Sign_Language">ASL</a> as much as possible. (Fact that occasionally surprises people: I had a sign-language interpreter through most of my childhood.)</p>
<p>If you're in the area, I would <em>love</em> to meet up, hang out, and hack with people. Ping me.</p>
<p>[Edit: Yep, that's Sunday, May 25, not June... thanks to Sa'am for pointing out that I'm spending 3 days, not 1 month, in DC.]</p>
