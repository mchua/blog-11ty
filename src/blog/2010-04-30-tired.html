<p>I guess it's probably time for me to <i>actually</i> find a doctor in Massachusetts. Antibiotics are sometimes a good idea. I will figure this out... tomorrow, when I can call various offices and see who's open.</p>
<p>There are a lot of things on my to-do list for the weekend. "Sleep" and "rest" are two of them. There's a bunch more. I'd like to finish fixing up my email infrastructure, I hope to poke my parents about that 529 again (I'm <i>trying</i> to wrap my finances up and that's the last thing I don't have), I need to start booking travel for the summer both for myself and for other people doing POSSE. That's all for Sunday-if-I-get-around-to-it, though. Tomorrow's sprinting is all Sugar Labs stuff.</p>
<p>Weekend. I can haz it.</p>
