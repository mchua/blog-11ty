<p>The first <a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Health_Jam_Seattle">Health Jam</a> is over and some <a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Health_Jam_Seattle/results">notes</a> are here. My scattered thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>It was the smallest Jam I've ever been to.</li>
<li>Accessibility of space is important - they locked the doors on us, the building was a maze, and I don't know how many participants we lost because they couldn't <em>find</em> us.</li>
<li>Man, we need a better HPI. (Human Participation Interface. It's like an API, but for volunteers. Seth and I are now using the acronym quite a bit between ourselves.)</li>
<li><a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/User:Sethwoodworth">Seth</a> and <a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/User:Ixo">Iain</a><br />
are even cooler in person than they are online. It was once 5am before Seth and I forced ourselves to stop talking so that we could get some sleep.</li>
<li>In retrospect, eating a 6-egg chili omelet over hash browns in one sitting may not have been the brightest idea I've ever had.</li>
<li>MUMPS is pretty awesome - not the disease, the programming language. It's also <em>incredibly </em>ugly and feels like swinging around a sledgehammer, but I actually... like it. I want to keep on playing with this.</li>
</ul>
<p>We did get <a href="http://thedailywashington.edu/2008/4/23/nonprofit-group-visits-campus-hopes-give-one-laptop">covered in the student paper</a> - the cute kid in the second picture is my cousin Neil.</p>
