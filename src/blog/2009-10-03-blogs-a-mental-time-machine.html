<p>While doing some FUDCon stuff, I ran across Paul's post referencing <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FUDCon:FUDConBoston2006">FUDCon 2006 in Boston</a>. Huh, I thought. I was 19 then, and not too far away, being a junior at Olin. What was I doing?</p>
<p>Turns out that I was <a href="http://blog.melchua.com/2006/04/08/things-i-learned-today/">making fudge</a> and <a href="http://blog.melchua.com/2006/04/10/why-is-engineering-uncool/">thinking about engineering education</a>. A bit later, I <a href="http://blog.melchua.com/2006/04/23/buying-in-without-selling-out/">started thinking about grad school</a>. It's interesting to see how your thinking evolves. (I really <i>do</i> write my blog for my future self. Cool!)</p>
<p>Ok, back to FUDCon stuff.</p>
