<p>Gentle early wake-up, exercising and stretching out on a sunny wooden floor, feeling my shoulders loosen their clench, my hip muscles release; drenching off sweat in a hot shower, pulling on clean soft clothes, reading a psychology book and then one on the history of Japanese martial arts, a sunny bikeride with newly pumped-up wheels. Warm sushi rice. Stitching together 3 different mental maps of how to navigate sub-areas of Boston; totally nailing my new song's chord progressions and finally, <em>finally </em>feeling fluency creep into improvising, thin thought bridges forming between the mathematical and auditory and kinesthetic islands of how I approach a keyboard. I'm starting to be able to be more than just a robot.</p>
<p>This week I've got another new song, Gillepsie's "Groovin' High." Usually it takes a few lessons before I'm ready for a new song, but I've started to get into a regular practice groove and the learning's coming easier; the world of jazz piano isn't quite as undifferentiatedly baffling. I still don't speak the language, but the syllables are no longer painfully foreign to listen to). I think I've learned how to learn jazz pieces now, at least enough that I can look at other things for a bit while I plateau on this. Kevin pointed out a turnaround in "For All We Know" I'd missed, got me to play a 3-against-4 rhythm (I keep thinking that piece is in 3/4 time anyway, even if I play it in 4/4) and listen to my left hand answering the right. I have a tendency to need to play more sparsely - I try to cram too many thoughts and techniques in parallel and none of them get through. I'm starting to be able to listen to myself do these things.</p>
<p>We played with the sound of a dominant major plus the major of its tritone; I need to practice resolving diminished chords in different keys. Eb major no longer scares me; I find myself transposing sheet music - haltingly, sure, but being able to transpose it on the fly <em>at all</em> is something I'd never done before. And this week I'm working on getting comfortable with nines and flat nines (a C major 9 chord is C, E, G, Bb, and then the D above the Bb; a flat 9 is the Db) in all the different keys, since I can feel out 7s now; I can hear the chord in my head and my hands just find the notes. This as opposed to several months ago, where I was "Um... that would... 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7... but then a half-step down and whoa that sounds really weird did I really play that right? Math math math math math... yes, I guess that's actually right." I can play it without the math. There's a tiny sprout of musical intuition finally creeping into my brain.</p>
<p>Making sushi. Golliwog's Cakewalk. Garbanzo chocolate cake, banana (ripe), unsweetened soy milk. Work, dreaming.</p>
<p>Another day like this tomorrow. Life is good.</p>
