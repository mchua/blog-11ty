<p>It was a good meeting this morning, and a lovely lunch (Ole Time, of course) with Max and Greg. Greg now has a mug, vast quantities of food and beer were consumed (by other people - I tried a bit of mead and actually was not that hungry tonight) and after that I sat in my rental car and played guitar a bit, figured out the chords for "Dancing in the Dark," and then discovered there was dancing, and went dancing. Mmm, <a href="http://rdublues.org/blues_002.htm">blues.</a> </p>
<p>Either the people there are very polite or I <i>am</i> getting better at dancing, because multiple leads sought me out multiple times - I only had to ask for the first few dances. I'm definitely plateauing, though - need to go to another workshop (I've only ever b<a href="http://blog.melchua.com/2006/09/10/oh-my-feet/">een to one</a>) and figure out what to work on next. Fortunately, <a href="http://www.dancebix.com/?cat=5">bix</a> is coming up.</p>
<p>Dancing is becoming something that's consistently good for making my brain quiet when I'm thinking too much. Even Mel (Greg's wife) noticed that tonight when I was passing her notes at dinner (the room was noisy!) about whether she'd like a sous-chef at some point, because I would very much like to learn Southern cooking (and how to make collards edible).</p>
<p>The results:</p>
<blockquote><p>[X] Yes! Minions are cool!<br />[&nbsp; ] Huh?</p></blockquote>
<p>Yay! I can haz learn things.</p>
