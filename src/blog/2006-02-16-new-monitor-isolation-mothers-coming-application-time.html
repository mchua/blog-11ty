<p>My monitor - a 19" widescreen LCD - arrived two weeks ago. I love it. With that monitor and the addition of an ergonomic keyboard and the "I'm not a travel mouse!" mouse, my back and wrists don't yell at me after extended computer sessions.</p>
<p>On the downside, I spend a lot more time working in my room. As opposed to working in the lounges and being - well, social. Sure, I'm being hyperefficient. Out of dire need, too; a week of high fever sapped all the productivity out of me, so I'm catching up on 5 days' worth of backlog, a nontrivial task. On the other hand, I'm rapidly reaching my tolerance for isolation. Gotta get out more.</p>
<p>Just found out that my mom is flying up right before spring break to accompany me to the doctor's office. (My jaw's out of alignment, which is a nuisance to me and a Terror-Stricken Harbinger of Doom for her; Mom's an ex-dentist.) I told her that I was almost twenty and perfectly <span style="font-style: italic;">fine </span>on my own and please save the money from the plane ticket, but it "makes her feel better" this way. I also don't know how long she's staying. Result: goodbye, spring break plans, hello, mom. Hopefully I'll be able to convince her someday that I'm actually an adult. Or close enough.</p>
<p>I also need to find a way to prove to places - namely, Study Abroad summer programs - that I'm a somewhat intelligent and responsible individual, despite not having (anywhere near) a 4.0 GPA. Ah well. I chose to deal with this problem when I decided to care about learning over grades. Things will work out.</p>
