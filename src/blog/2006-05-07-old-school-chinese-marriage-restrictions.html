<p>I don't get this. Can someone please explain to me what the trouble is with
<ul>
<li>boys marrying girls who are taller than them, and</li>
<li>girls marrying boys who are less educated than them?</li>
</ul>
<p>Not that these are hard-and-fast requirements for me (or that, y'know, I'm planning to get married in the first place), but I've heard enough talk about them around the family circle that I'm curious as to whether they're old-school Chinese or just old-school... whatever. It's not so much a "thou shalt not" as it is "You know, boys generally don't like girls who have higher degrees..." comment. Anyone ever heard similar? What do you think?</p>
