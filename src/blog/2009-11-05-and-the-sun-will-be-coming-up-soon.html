<p>Looking at timestamps, tonight is one night I'm quite grateful for my extremely fine-grained sensitivity to - and control of - how much sleep my mind and body need. It's lovely to have that ability honed.</p>
<p>Bedtime for a bit, then biking into town for GOSCON (once I figure out how to bike with nice pants without ruining them).</p>
