<p><em>This was my last email as an OLPC employee.</em></p>
<p>Folks, </p>
<p>I'm psyched to be (re)joining the community as a volunteer once more - after all, I've been an employee for 3.8 months and a community member for... running over 2 years now. This isn't an ending, just another step - and I for one welcome our new overlor^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H I mean, I'm looking forward to it.</p>
<p>I'll continue to manage 8.2.1 testing as a volunteer, among other things - see the scoop on how QA is moving forward as an all-community entity at http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Community_testing_meetings/2009-01-08. I may<br />
make an appearance around Australia (http://linux.conf.au/) and Oceania in general (hello, Welly testers!) and... oh, maybe other places. It's a big world out there.</p>
<p>Now - I've got a bunch of embedded/signal processing/sociology/engineering-education books that have been calling my name for ages... and a piano that I have ignored for years. (Ideas on other fun things to do next are welcomed!) Thank you for all your help, support, teaching, ideas, tolerance, enthusiasm, critiques, inspiration and just plain ol' companionship along this crazy ride. It's been good - and will continue to be good. Sweet.</p>
<p>Cheers, then - I'll be seeing you folks around.</p>

<p>PS: Michael, what's a social-life? We don't seem to include that in our packages (http://dev.laptop.org/~bert/joyride/2622)...</p>
