<p>I did pick up a bunch of "how to make things better-scaffolded and more familiar to academics" tips and observations at today's TA training workshop. Some ideas I'll be stealing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Color-code  worksheets by activity, which makes them easier to find  and reference.  "The pink packet" is much quicker to distinguish and  grab than "the  'managing learning environments' handout," and isn't  actually much more  expensive to print.</li>
<li>In the handout packet for each activity,  include a "Suggested  Reading" bibliography referencing a couple good  books and/or papers.  They did this rather nicely with a front to each  worksheet, which  consists of a description, goal, learning objectives,  and suggested  reading all on one page. Then there were notes/content,  then worksheet-type stuff in the back.</li>
<li>Every time I go to a  workshop of some sort, I keep on being  reminded -- as much as we've  entered the digital age, having something  solid in your hands to take  home is <em>really</em> important. There's a  sense of physicality there, a  mental jog to make sure you have access to  what was covered, and...  just having a <em>thing</em> helps you remember to think about it. (Gosh, it's weird to start thinking in physical space again!)</li>
</ul>
