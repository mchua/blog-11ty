<p>(The actual comic is at the end. Scroll to skip my ramble.)</p>
<p>I had to summarize a book related to Gender, Race, and/or Class for homework, and came across <em>The Alphabet vs the Goddess, </em>which intriguingly purported to show how feminine/holistic/visuals lost out against its binary complement of masculine/linear/words in spirituality, science, politics, and everything else under the sun. Knowing nothing other than that (gleaned from the blurby back cover), I borrowed the book from Alice and flew to NYC the weekend before the thing was due, intending to do my summary as feminine/holistic/visuals in order to play with whatever points the book was going to make about it.</p>
<p>The book turned out to be full of masculine/linear/words, an irony that did not escape me. Irate at the self-reflexivity of the book, Mel-commentary exploded all over my "summary," turning it into a book review. It's not a <em>bad </em>book, I just... <em>why is this a bestseller?</em> It has interesting ideas from an obviously very smart and curious author, but that's what it is: a semi-researched, not-particularly-backed-up braindump of (eloquently-phrased) thoughts that <em>sound </em>more solid (thanks, eloquent phrasing!) than they actually are under scrutiny.</p>
<p>For instance: the author mentions that printing presses -- which used both the force of compression and the material of linen strips -- arrived in China around the same time female footbinding (which used both the force of compression and the material of linen strips), and goes on about the <em>agonizing pain of young girls!</em> in such vivid prose that it's easy to forget that correlation and causation are not the same thing. Harold Hill's character in <em>The Music Man </em>used the same tactic: "You've got trouble / Right here in River City / with a capital T and that rhymes with P and that stands for POOL!" (For those unfamiliar with the tactic, think: does the fact that the first letter of a word rhymes with T make that thing inherently troublesome?) Here, we've got Trouble with a capital T and that rhymes with P and that stands for Printing... and I don't buy it.</p>
<p>Anyway. My book review was full of the following sentiment: I <em>wanted </em>to like this book and I <em>do </em>like parts of it but BOY does it overstep with NO DISCLAIMERS on the boundary between backed-up arguments and the author's personal poetic conjectures.</p>
<p>Not that my book review itself is spotless. I like the first page a lot -- and then my own argument goes awry, and the pieces seem disconnected to me, in part because I didn't want to do it in sequential comic-frame format, in an attempt to swing way to the feminine/holistic/visual side of that binary the author sets up so strongly. It's pretty reflexive. It's also very much a "look, Mel's experimenting with a new format!" experiment. I <em>am</em> proud of the way I thought of to do citations of a visual work (on the last page of the pdf).</p>
<p>I'm still trying to figure out how to best store/catalogue my (growing) collection of sketches so it's easy for people to access it, so here's an experiment: evernote embedding. (I have a nagging suspicion this might force browsers to download the entire pdf to view this page, but if so, I will leave this up as a concrete example of my terrible mistake.)</p>
