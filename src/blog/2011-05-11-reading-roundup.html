<p>Playing with wordpress themes, mostly minimalist ones - I've enjoyed <a href="http://tammyhartdesigns.com/free-wordpress-themes/fifty-fifth-street/">fifty-fifth street</a> and <a href="http://demo.jimbarraud.com/manifest/">manifest</a> and would love to take them apart and see how they work.</p>
<p>Came across a delightful quote from jwz.<br />
<blockquote>...you can't take a dying project, sprinkle it with the magic pixie dust of ``open source,'' and have everything magically work out.</p></blockquote>
<p>The <a href="http://www.jwz.org/gruntle/nomo.html">full essay</a> is<br />
worth reading - and keep in mind this was 1999. Many of the same things<br />
still apply, but it's also nice to look and see how far we've come (and<br />
how far we haven't).</p>
<p>The essay <a href="http://nplusonemag.com/bad-education">"Bad Education"</a> (comparing higher education to a bubble similar to the sub-prime lending crisis) is provocative and I wish it were better cited - it's got some pretty big claims there and I'd love to see where they're drawing the conclusions from.</p>
<p>I need to force myself to watch my full <a href="http://www.posscon.org/mel-chua-and-sebastian-dziallas/">POSSCON talk video</a>. It's painful to critique yourself as a speaker, but that's how we learn. (I <i>know</i> that presentation isn't my best because of the large number of significant last-minute changes that went on, so I dread this a little.)</p>
