<p>It's time for one of those rarities: a post on this blog made almost exclusively from nifty links.</p>
<p><a href="http://dotsub.com/">dotSUB</a> makes me happy (and informed!) It's a site where you can subtitle (and translate) videos and podcasts, and its interface is a lot handier than my <a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/WikiTranscript">WikiTranscript</a> idea (which may still be useful in terms of seeding something like dotSUB with a starter transcription - I need to play with the <a href="http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/html/cmusphinx.php">Sphinx </a>voice rec engine more, though). I have never been able to understand an entire podcast before without the help of a friend or a text transcript hosted elsewhere on a website (and seriously, folks, it's so much <em>nicer</em> when you don't have to scroll through the text yourself...)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/tr35/Profile.aspx?Cand=T&TRID=613">Ivan Kristic</a> is amazing. He's the inventor of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitfrost">Bitfrost </a>(which is <a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Bitfrost">fascinating</a>; read the <a href="http://dev.laptop.org/git.do?p=security;a=blob;hb=HEAD;f=bitfrost.txt">spec </a>here), director of security at OLPC... and needs to have his office pranked sometime ;-)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ethanzuckerman.com/blog/2007/07/27/the-5-4-3-double-play-or-the-art-of-conference-blogging">Conference blogging</a> (courtesy Ethan Zuckerman) - you mean there's a word for what I do, and other people post their notes to blogs? Sweet! This brings back memories of last year's <a href="http://wikimania2006.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikimania</a>, when I coordinated session transcriptions (using a <a href="http://gobby.0x539.de/trac/">gobby </a>document for each talk). Conclusion: notetaking is too much of an individual effort for this kind of thing to work - you end up with one person being the primary typer and others editing. I'm going to try doing this at the next conference I'm at - announce I'm taking notes on a gobby server and invite others to join me, but take responsibility for posting my own notes to a wiki somewhere. I think it will help, since I love taking notes on <em>everything</em>, type pretty fast, and have a hard time catching words sometimes during speeches (basically, if I look away for a few second, I have no idea what the speaker's saying - the disadvantage to being lipreading-reliant and using a Markov-type model to guess missed words through context).</p>
<p>Turn off your <a href="http://www.globalvoicesonline.org/2007/08/16/japan-living-with-the-heat/">air conditioning</a>.</p>
<p>I'm sorely tempted by these t-shirts, although I know I don't need them (and have enough shirts, really). Also, I appreciate that <a href="http://www.questionablecontent.net/">Questionable Content </a> sells geeky girls' t-shirts. I almost don't want to admit this because I have (or had?) a longstanding aversion to thinking/talking about clothes and curves and hate sounding remotely "girly," but they... look (and feel) a lot better on me (as far as I'm concerned) than normal guys' t-shirts. Most of my wardrobe could still be worn by a guy my size, though.</p>

<li><a href="http://www.questionablecontent.net/shirts/midlarge.png">Math is delicious!</a> (my favorite)</li>
</ul>
<p>That's all for now.</p>
