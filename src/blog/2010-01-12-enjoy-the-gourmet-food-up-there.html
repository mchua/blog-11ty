<p>I'll miss you, <a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/User:ScottSwanson">Scott</a>. I'd hoped to see you one last time, but I guess you don't always know when you say goodbye that it's going to be the last time. You and Arjun, Katie, Jason, and Yifan <a href="http://blog.melchua.com/2009/01/09/only-inadvertently-a-minor-kind-of-ending/">being in Boston this time last year</a> was one of the things that kept me going then, and I'm glad we had the chance to have the conversations we did. You, sir, inspire me.</p>
<p>Enjoy the gourmet food up there. I hear it's great. I'll see you in about 80 years or so.</p>
