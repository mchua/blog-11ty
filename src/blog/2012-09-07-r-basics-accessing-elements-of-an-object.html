<p>Because I remember things better when I explain them, and because accessing elements inside a list in R is just <em>barely</em> different enough from other programming languages I'm used to that it's throwing me off with false cognates a bit -- here's a brief tour on basic ways to access objects in an R list. This is elementary R, but I'm a novice R programmer taking notes for my own reference, so hey.</p>
<p>Note that the "&gt;" at the start of some lines is the R prompt ("stuff you should type"), but that you shouldn't type the "&gt;." Everything else is print output that R will display to you.</p>
<p>First we need to create a <em>list</em> which we'll call <code>mylist</code>.</p>
<p><code><br />
&gt; mylist &lt;- list(component = c(1,2,3))<br />
</code></p>
<p><code>mylist</code> is a super-simple list. Its contents look like this:</p>
<p><code><br />
&gt; mylist<br />
$component<br />
[1] 1 2 3<br />
</code></p>
<p>This list only has one <em>element</em>. It is named <code>component</code>. (It also has one attribute, as Jerzy pointed out in the comments below -- the single attribute is called "names".)</p>
<p><code><br />
&gt; attributes(mylist)<br />
$names<br />
[1] "component"<br />
</code></p>
<p>We can access the element named component in a few ways:</p>
<p><code><br />
&gt; mylist["component"]<br />
&gt; mylist[1]<br />
</code></p>
<p>One uses the element name, the other uses the index number. Both of these return a list, which looks like this when it's printed out -- note the <code>$component</code> at the top. Inside the list is a vector of 3 numbers.</p>
<p><code><br />
$component<br />
# [1] 1 2 3<br />
</code></p>
<p>If you want to reach inside the list and get the stuff inside -- in this case, that vector of 3 numbers -- you can do it two ways as well: with the attribute name or the index number.</p>
<p><code><br />
&gt; mylist$component<br />
&gt; mylist[[1]]<br />
</code></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both of them will return simply the vector -- it won't be wrapped in a list. Note how there's no <code>$component</code> label at the top.</p>
<p><code><br />
[1] 1 2 3<br />
</code></p>
<p>Since <code>mylist$component</code> and <code>mylist[[1]]</code> return whatever is inside this list, and in this case it is a vector, we can access elements in it just like any other vector.</p>
<p><code><br />
&gt; mylist$component[2]<br />
&gt; mylist[[1]][2]<br />
</code></p>
<p>And you'll simply get that second number in the vector.</p>
<p><code><br />
[1] 2<br />
</code></p>
<p>I read on <a href="http://www.johndcook.com/R_language_for_programmers.html">John Cook's "R langauge for programmers"</a> that you can think of R lists as C-style structs. That's not too bad.</p>
<p>Side note: R typically gives you columns (for instance, <code>mymatrix[1]</code> gives you the first column of <code>mymatrix</code>), but if you throw a comma afterwards it'll give you rows. (For instance, <code>mymatrix[1,]</code> gives you the first row of <code>mymatrix</code>). You can combine these: <code>mymatrix[c(1,2,3),c(1,2)]</code> gives you the first 3 rows of the first 2 columns of <code>mymatrix</code>.</p>
