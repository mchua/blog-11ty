<p><em>(Edit: separate image descriptions now added to all slides, in addition to the visual information that's been embedded in the transcript from the start - thanks to Christian Vogler and Sina Bahram for feedback and ongoing learning on how to make things more accessible to others.)</em></p>
<p>Slides and a lightly edited transcript of my dissertation defense are now available online in full, for those who have been asking.</p>
<p>The slides alone don't make much sense -- but the transcript (in the speaker notes) describes all the images and diagrams, so the transcript alone should actually make sense. The transcript also includes the audience questions, with the audience members anonymized.</p>
<p>I'm struggling a bit on how to publish this online in a reasonable way, and would love feedback/suggestions. But for right now:</p>
<ol>
<li>You can go straight to the slide deck (look at the speaker notes!) <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xAqarn-vr66RD0Slt_hXzNf7gd7wvGYIs2eZ1lfSskc/edit#slide=id.g1b1532b63c_0_48">at this google slides link</a>, though I doubt that's a good long-term hosting solution for this content... so that link may stop working at some point in the future. I also have no idea how this works with screenreaders (edit: but the notes have full image descriptions now.)</li>
<li>You can also <a href="http://blog.melchua.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Mel-Dissertation-Defense-1.pdf">download a PDF</a> that has the slides and transcript (edit: and image descriptions), and this is likely the easiest way to read it. However, it's a format that's hard to modify, and again -- I don't know how various screenreaders will treat it. (I need to up that portion of my accessibility game.)</li>
<li>Slides are embedded below, and if you click on them, they will open up full-screen. Then you can click on the gear icon in the bottom-left, then "speaker notes" to view the speaker notes -- or type 's' as a keyboard shortcut.</li>
</ol>
