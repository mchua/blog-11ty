<p>Decided yesterday that (someday) I want to learn about finance. I want to be able to make sure that the things I care about will never run out of resources - or if it's inevitable or designed to be that way, that we come in for a graceful, gentle landing. I want to learn how grants work, how funding works, how investments work, how money is managed, how to monitor it even if you don't control its flow, how things are appraised and valued, how... how that part of the world works, so I know that mindset and communicate to folks who have it.</p>
<p>I also want to be able to consciously step <i>out</i> of it because it's not ultimately the stuff I care about and I don't want to get caught up in it without me knowing. Book recommendations welcome. I'm wincing whenever I think about learning this stuff, so I would love to talk to someone who actually <i>enjoys</i> finance so I can try to grok what's interesting and fun about it.</p>
<p>The desire to learn finance is definitely borne from a sense of duty towards things I love. I have no love for duty, but I take the duties of love seriously. So when I commit to a cause, I go <i>completely ninja</i> on it. And then I'm tired. But it's the good sort of tired.</p>
