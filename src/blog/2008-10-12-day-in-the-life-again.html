<p>Wake up. Go back to sleep. Wake up. Go back to sleep. Wake up. Realize putting off making the floor appear again will not make the floor appear; pick up my room.</p>
<p>Open fridge. "AIEE VEGETABLES GOING BAD!" Steam, stir-fry, and consume inane amounts of bok choy, tofu.</p>
<p>Chris: "Leslie gave me a brewing kit!" Me: "YAY!"</p>
<p>Blender blender blender shake shake shake shake peach plum apple soymilk yum.</p>
<p>Reply to 262 emails. Decide a better strategy of handling emails will be needed soon.</p>
<p>Train! Olin challenge fail! (Ran into Jessie Sullivan.) Buy beer brewing supplies with Chris! Go "zomg must now learn biology and chemistry!" (This for the something-dozenth time - it seems like I need Massive Spiral Learning to get even the basics of those two subjects into my head. That is okay. At least I know this now.)</p>
<p>Bus! MaunaLoa! "I brought cheese and bread for the eating of the cheese!" "Yay!" "This room needs more photons!" "Yes! Yes! The light is broken!"</p>
<p>That's it so far - I have way too much energy to dissipate through typing alone, so I'm going to run around a while after I post this up...</p>
