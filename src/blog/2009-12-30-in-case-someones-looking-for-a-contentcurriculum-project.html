<p><a href="http://inventwithpython.com/">Invent Your Own Computer Games With Python</a> looks like a great base for remixing into a "how to make your own Activities" guide for students - it's written so <a href="http://inventwithpython.com/whofor.html">9-10 year olds</a> can understand it. And it is indeed remixable; the license is <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/us/">BY-NC-SA.</a></p>
