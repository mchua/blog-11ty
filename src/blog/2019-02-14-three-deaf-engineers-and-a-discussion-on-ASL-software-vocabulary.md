*A conversation that was too delightful not to share (with permission). Very lightly edited for flow and readability, but this is me and Ian Smith and John Ying nerding out about some of the sign drafts for ASLCore Computer Science, as a "here's what this can look like" glimpse.*

Mel: Hey Ian - my friend John (also a deaf engineer, Boston) found aslcore stuff and had a thought re package vs library

John: i didn't want to bombard the other thread, but i'd thought package and library are conceptually the same thing. i saw the suggestion for package and had assumed the same for library until just now.

to me it's just a collection of code put together as one unit to be reused. there's dependencies and all that, those are additional details to me.

Ian: Hmm! Need to think on that. But maybe. Also, like, package includes debs and rpms, which are not (to me) libraries, so...

John: hmm true. packages are like, things to distribute around, while libraries can be contained just within the program

Mel: Yeah, "package" strongly hints at that encapsulation-for-distribution thing. (the sign, I mean). And I was also thinking about rpms, etc. (former red hat employee and really active fedora contributor, here)

Ian: there's a reason i ermembered to specify "and rpms" :laugh:)

And a library may be contained by a package, but the package may also contain binaries, etc

Mel: So I think - this is me backwards reconstructing, but I think the distinction was - Package: a bunch of software encapsulated together in a chunk you can use. Library: software bits pulled in from outside the specific piece of code you're working on and used as dependencies.

John: thanks i think that makes sense

Mel: We need to get these kinds of discussions out and visible too, though, so people can see how we discuss language... Would the two of you mind if I blogged out this convo real quick?

John: not at all

Ian: Do it!

John: also, i'm not familiar with the classifier used for parameter / argument. it's the one that looks like an L handshape being stuffed in a package? same question goes for key / value / key-value.

Mel: Yes! L to bent-L, I think! (Ian? actual linguistics term?) There's an expansion that might help clarify why, lemme see if I can find.

Ok, for the parameter/argument one, see the expansion of "function" at https://aslcore.org/computerscience/entries/?id=function&src=search

Last video there, "execute a function." She doesn't use the sign for "argument" until the very end, so wait for it.

John:  ahh i see it now

Mel: What was the question about key/value/pair?

John: just watched the suggestion for key-value again, and realized that i'd misunderstood the bent L handshape as something else. looks like the bent L handshape is used to represent a variable or some value in general

Mel: I think that started with the sign for "variable" Because of how we sign things like... (one sec, video) [makes video of herself using the same bent-L handshape to explain the concept of compound words]

John: yeah, i saw that in the suggestion for variable - so key-value is something you "unlock" to get the value within some "thing" / variable.

not sure how i feel about using the actual sign for "key" but then it's the same idea. just watching it make me think of some actual door key

Mel: Yeah, using the actual sign for key also makes me go "ehhhh?" but... pilot/placeholder/draft

Ian: what was the q for me? how to gloss that?  how to transcribe it phonetically?

Mel: "what is that handshape called"

Ian: I think i think of that handshape as open-C? Or there's some variation on C. But "bent-L" works

John: at this point i'm just thinking aloud here, no specific q at the moment

Mel: Yeah, that handshape (which we've been calling bent-L) has a pretty common usage as "here's this placeholder for some kind of content!" - at least to me, and seems to be how many people use it.

John: yeah bent-L works for me. the open-C one might be for code in general like how it's used in pull/push

Mel:  A small bit of content ex: a string, a word, etc.

John: i've seen it used in math, as a classifier for number

Mel: So it's used for all the places we need to refer to variables for that reason

Ian: I think of that classifier as "small thing"

John: and, nice highlights, you've come a long way since i saw you... last year

Mel: [re: long way - ] the signing, or the hair? ;)

Ian: :snort:

Mel: Well, you met me as a totally beginning signer. (Ian met me as a completely oral kid, in undergrad, which was hilarious.)

Ian: And a defensive oral kid, sorta :laugh:, though to be fair I was not much less oral

John: me three, oral kid growing up, learned ASL after undergrad, yay?

Mel: And look at us now.

John: buncha computer science nerds discussing ASL lingustics
I am - hopefully - working towards being able to offer full-blown electrical engineering undergraduate content in ASL (this is a tremendous and daunting task, and I have a lot to learn along the way). It's my field, and I know I have a gift for teaching it and creating materials for learning; I want to... not so much "make good materials for DHH students," but "make the best materials for anyone looking to learn my field, period" - and then have it JUST SO HAPPEN that those materials are in ASL (with captions and voiceover). So if people want the good stuff, it'll be signed. That's what I want my contribution towards turning the tide to be.

Better description of this: Imagine high-quality, open-licensed, online introductory college course materials for technical topics (my realms are computer/electrical/software engineering, so I'll be focusing there).

They happen to be in ASL, and are full-blown exemplifications of all the gorgeous linguistic affordances ASL has for spatial descriptions, personification, collaborative signing (multiple people using their hands and bodies to illustrate a concept together -- I'm the wire, you're the electrons rushing through, etc.) and so forth.

I've experimented with some of this with hearing non-signers, both students and faculty; if I tell them the topic and start signing with conceptual clarity, they can often voice me and get really excited. For instance, if you know some basic programming, see the expansion videos for "function" (https://aslcore.org/computerscience/entries/?id=function) and "call (a function)" (https://aslcore.org/computerscience/entries/?id=call) in ASLCore - it's a computing concept distinct from what we usually gloss as FUNCTION ("what function does that object perform"), and the hearing professors who've seen it have mentioned it's the clearest explanation they have ever seen, in any language (and again, they don't know any ASL).

Those are from pilot round of developing vocabulary for https://aslcore.org/engineering/ and https://aslcore.org/computerscience (we're currently at that first-draft pilot point, and there needs to be a lot of work on feedback/refining, but I'm veering off on a tangent there). But imagine an entire college course on introductory program where the lectures look like that. And the homework/activities have visuals (diagrams, etc.) that echo the signs and then later explain how the concepts are written out in English (or whatever) as a secondary language (for the course). And the labs involve prototyping these concepts with your hands/bodies/props/drawings/etc. first, and THEN doing the math/code/circuitry/etc. implementations.

Also critically: this is not material designed just for DHH learners or those who already know ASL. It is a living showcase of how amazing ASL can be for learning advanced technical topics. Take all the things Deaf theatre is trying to do, and bring it into the classroom. (Again, I do college-level STEM stuff, so I'm going to start on my home turf.)

For this, there are also access streams (in the vein of subtitles/audio descriptions/transcripts) so that others can access the beauty of the descriptions in ASL. These are specifically NOT interpretations into English. Instead, I'd take the approach the Flying Words Project started -- what supplementary information do people need to learn how to see the beauty in the ASL versions? So: sound effects, voicing of strategic words, explanatory "here's how to watch this" bits available before key lecture videos, animated overlays showing what our classifers are depicting, etc. (there's a recent video I'm trying to find that does this for an ASL poem).

Also: this would be designed so there would be workable combinations for DHH-nonsigner, hearing-sighted, hearing-blind, and DeafBlind audiences -- I want these accessible to as many people as possible.

The dream would be to someday be able to have materials for every single typical within-major core course in a standard electrical/computer engineering curriculum, which is generally something along the lines of these four courses/topics:

- introduction to programming and software engineering
- analog circuits (DC and AC)
- digital logic and computer architecture
- signals and systems (this is how audiological devices work, btw - imagine labs that have students explaining how their CI works.)

Bonus rounds:
- microelectronics/mechatronics
- analog and digital / wireless communications

This is a lifetime of work. Tremendous work. Requiring many people and many years. I won't finish. This won't look anything like I imagine, and I'm still getting up the courage to dream about it in public (hi).

More thoughts in the comments with musings/requests, to break up this... epic long post.

So here's some of what I'm thinking, too.

I'm Deaf, grew up oral, and learned ASL as a young adult (in the middle of my PhD in engineering edu). My work has been situated in the realms of electrical, computer, and software engineering pedagogy in adult learning situations (college and beyond). I've done extensive work on building open online resources and communities centered around technical concepts - it's something I have an international reputation for, a knack for, and a deep love of. I'm pretty uniquely positioned to bring together resources for this.

Honestly, I have constant doubts as to whether I should even be doing this, if this will become some kind of exotic signing inspiration porn thing, if I'm "Deaf Enough" as a non-native signer who has good spoken language skills, all of that impostor syndrome stuff (but also good caution in terms of checking my privilege and the ways people could misuse this kind of thing).

I also know things I want to be specifically watchful of from the start.

1. I'm Deaf, and I use ASL pretty heavily in my own life and work, but I'm not a native signer. I want to direct recognition towards honoring and supporting the work of those more linguistically skilled than I am. Some of this material would be performed by CDIs, Deaf actors, etc. (Other materials would be performed by a wide variety of DHH technical professionals -- with coaching by ASL specialists -- so they can show their individual signing accents but with as much clarity as possible.)

2. I'm trying to bring awareness to Deaf Gain in engineering/tech/computing education. I'm not an expert on Deaf culture; I want, again, to point to and provide resources to and honor the long history of people who have built and studied Deaf culture, arts, history, language, etc. They have the expertise, not me. (Engineers are particularly bad at assuming they can quickly become experts in anything, so it's good for them to learn how to honor the skills of other fields.) 

3. So much intersectionality and privilege wound up in this, and I want to be thoughtful towards it. I will mess up a ton, and can only hope the communities around me will call me out so I can learn (and work to be someone worth teaching).

Last part of the braindump, wherein I specifically ask for advice.

Specifically, I have some time to learn and train up. It'll take at least 2-3 years to write/get a grant to even start it anyway, and to get to a position in my career where I can even propose it (gotta deal with my ADHD and finish my damn PhD first). I have the technical/pedagogical knowledge and ways to improve on that -- I can make an open online engineering course with excellent materials.

What I feel underconfident in are my linguistic/cultural skills. And I'm trying to dive into shoring these up in the time I have, but am wrestling with how to do so.

I'm comfortable signing. It's become my preferred langauge in many settings, to my great surprise. But I also have all of 2 weeks of formal ASL classes, a mainstream accent, and spotty grammar knowledge largely gleaned from nerding out with sign language linguists and reading some of their papers/books.

I'm heavily biased towards academic ASL environments/people, and want to expand this range. Much of my sign exposure/usage is in academic/professional settings, and most of my close Deaf friends are academics. All that means that I can chat comfortably with signers who are fluent in either or both of ASL and English (and have flexibility and repair skills), but struggle with folks with marked language deprivation, little kids, Deaf+, international signing accents ("I wish I had some of the receptive and communication negotiation skills that CDIs have, but where do you learn that?")

Yeah, I know, hang out with Deaf people. I am. Folks (in Rochester, anyway) have told me either "you're fine" or "just hang out more with Deaf folks," but... sometimes it helps to have guidance/structure to learn how to analyze and deliberately practice what you're seeing when you hang out. And there's the cultural aspect as well -- growing up with a hearing family that doesn't sign, mainstreaming my whole life, every moment I see what it could look like for this to be normal... is just precious. And also helpful towards figuring out how to build this project, which in many ways is "what if we had culturally Deaf engineering education environments? What would that look like?"

How would you cobble together a training program for this, knowing my long-term project goals? How would you think about it? I'm just going as fast and hard as I can, and bouncing off walls and picking up stuff, so any and all input is incredibly welcomed.
