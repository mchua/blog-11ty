<p>...it has a drop-in problem. From a 2008 paper by Ohland et al:</p>
<p>Engineering has the highest persistence rate of any undergraduate major. These are percentage numbers for matriculation-to-graduation: if you take a snapshot of all students at the moment they first declare their major, how many <i>stay</i> in that major 'till they graduate?
<ul>
<li>engineering 57%</li>
<li>business 55%</li>
<li>science &amp; math 44%</li>
<li>computer science 38%</li>
</ul>
<p>I dunno about you, but I can't remember the last time I heard someone bemoaning the high dropout rates of business school undergrads. So what's the problem?</p>
<p>Nobody's coming in. Engineering students "drop into" other fields, but other fields don't "drop into" engineering... likely for a variety of reasons. For instance, engineering tends to have a ton of course requirements and prerequisites, so someone switching to engineering is likely to need to tack an extra few semesters to their time in college. The difference is stark; whereas other fields have a "drop-in" rate (percentage of students who graduate with a major who had <i>not</i> initially declared that major) of 35-59%...</p>
<p>...engineering is at 7%. We basically have a one way door. You can't come in, but you can leave.</p>
<p>Fascinating.</p>
