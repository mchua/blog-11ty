<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">So. I'm twenty-one. I went and had my first shot (rum and orange juice, plus a series of tiny jello shots to see what the effect of alcohol on gelatin's ability to coagulate was - turns out that pineapple has a bigger effect thatn alcohol does.) Oh. And alcohol... tastes... nasty. But really, birthdays - not such a big deal any more. An occasion to mark the passage of time, an occasion to have some nice food (with my family later tonight) and to reflect a bit, but otherwise like any other day - which means that... yes, I'm working. Writing papers. YAY PAPERS.</p>
<p>Gui's <a href="http://robogeek.livejournal.com/44096.html">post </a>captures how I sometimes feel about the educational system. My comment captures what I (try to) do in response.</p>
<p><i>Guy: "And so you can see that the shell is injection-molded ABS, a low-cost plastic that's..."</i><br />Me: "Oh whoa, a toaster! Hey, what does this button do?"<br /><i>Guy: "Well, you're supposed to-" *smoke comes out of toaster*</i><br />Me: "COOL! Okay, so that lever is the..."<br /><i>Guy: "We cover that in unit three, where..."</i><br />Me: "Wait, is there a toaster book somewhere?"<br /><i>Guy: "The recommended list of textbooks...</i>"<br />Me:<br />*reading manual* "Ohhhhh, that's the darkness setting. Okay, I'm going<br />to need some more slices of bread... hey, is your toaster okay?"<br />Classmate: "I can't get an image of Elvis burnt onto my toast! What am I doing wrong?"<br />Me: "Well, you have your setting on 'Apparition Of The Virgin Mary.' But if you turn..."<br /><i>Guy: "Wait! That's not approved! The evaluations are next Tuesday!"</i><br />Me: "...and there you go! Elvis."<br />Classmate: "Whoa!"<br />Me: "I know!"<br />Classmate: "Thanks!"<br /><i>Guy: "But you don't know how it works!"</i><br />Me: "I think I've figured out how to use it - okay, so tell me, what's this nichrome wire stuff?"<br /><i>Guy: "The nichrome wire has a linear resistance of 1.75 ohms per foot, which, at 120 volts..."</i><br />Me: "Oooooh. Hey, that must be why that burnt. Why nichrome, why not... I dunno, tungsten or something?"<br /><i>Guy: "We don't cover that until -"</i><br />Me:<br />"What's the thermal mass of tungsten? Wait, don't tell me, I'll look it<br />up and you can holler if I'm wrong. I gotta go read. Ooh!" *distracted<br />by shiny*<br /><i>Guy: *shaking head* "She'll never learn."</i><i></p>
<p></i>My John Holt books came in the mail today, along with one called "Talking About Leaving," which is on a study about why undergraduates leave the sciences. I'm looking forward to reading that this summer. Right now... papers. Yes. And two 3x5ft posters for SCOPE.</div>
