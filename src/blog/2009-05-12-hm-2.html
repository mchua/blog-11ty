<p>I'm not sure how this happened, but I seem to be turning into a "I want to be <em>cool</em>Â on the internet!" coach despite not actually being all that cool on the internet myself. (I don't actually strategize/pay attention to my personal online presence, but it's easier to do for projects that aren't... me.)</p>
<p>Attempting to turn this into some sort of methodology. Then perhaps I can apply to self.</p>
<p>Also, my family is pretty awesome. Including brother. Who started a campus group called "Love as a force for social change," or "Love club" for short. I am impressed. And how he needs a website...</p>
