<div style="">Technology was the focus of the last day of our 4-day grassroots bootcamp, kicking off with a school server (XS) installation walkthrough led by Ankur Verma, Dan Drake, and Chris Carrick. Disassembly, repair centers and repair kits, how to write funding proposals, and more were covered in side conversations throughout the afternoon... </p>
<p>Unfortunately, we don't yet have documentation for these, since most attendees had to leave Thursday afternoon or evening, but we're working on it and will post them on the wiki page - that's <a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Grassroots_bootcamp/Results">http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Grassroots_bootcamp/Results</a> - when they're done. (There is a minimal transcript of the start of the XS installation session up there right now.)</p>
<p>A recap of the entire bootcamp will be coming in just a moment.</div>
