<p><strong></strong>It's not selling out; it's helping other people to buy in.</p>
<p>Besides, you can't be disruptive within a place you're not allowed into. (The point of graduate school was to get commit access to the academic culture repository so that you could use and share it for Great Awesome, so go get it.)</p>

Just write.<br />
Just sit down and write.</p>
<p>(And yes. This is hard.)</p>
