<p>I did something today I should have done a while back: relicensed all my blog and website content under I haven't actually thought about this before - crud, this makes my website incompatible with... FIX! FIX!"</p>
<p>My site and blog content are now compatible with the <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki">Fedora wiki</a>, itself <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Relicensing_OPL_to_CC_BY_SA">recently relicensed</a>. (And <a href="http://search.creativecommons.org/?q=commons+non+commercial&amp;sourceid=Mozilla-search">many other things as well.</a>)</p>
