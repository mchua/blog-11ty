<p>Dear Lazyweb:</p>
<p>I want a wireless headset for making video calls (and perhaps gaming someday, though my sense of productivity has resisted this so far). I travel frequently and would like something portable, durable, and with sufficient sound isolation so that when I turn the volume up to accommodate my severe hearing loss, I don't leak audio to everyone within a 30-foot radius. I'm willing to make an investment in good hardware, but my maximum budget cap is $200, and I'd prefer to stay under $100 if possible. Oh - and it has to work on Linux. (I run whatever the latest Fedora version is.)</p>
<p>Recommendations? Here are some things I've considered:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.buy.com/prod/sennheiser-mm-100-headset-stereo-behind-the-neck-binaural-open/q/sellerid/23907370/loc/111/214563113.html">Refurbished Sennheiser MM100 headset</a>, $56.15 - small, light, good reviews for audio quality both in/out. Disadvantage: it looks like it's going to leak sound and annoy my neighbors.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Wireless-Gaming-Headset-Surround/dp/B003VANOFY/ref=sr_1_2?s=STORE&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1285855584&amp;sr=1-2">Logitech wireless gaming headset G930</a>, $134.99 - good sound isolation and reviews of audio quality both in/out. Disadvantage: decidedly not uberportable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, I could always get a nice headset "for home" (although I'm "home" half the time or less these days, with my travel schedule) and a cheaper, smaller travel version for when I'm on the road... a travel version wouldn't necessarily need to be wireless. Thoughts? How do those of you who do a lot of VOIP, etc. calls home on the road handle this?</p>
