<p>Thanks to overhearing Arjun ask Bernie a question in IRC tonight, I figured out why my keyboard "broke" and how to "fix it." Now that I know the answer, it seems obvious in retrospect. To see why, take a look at the <a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/OLPC_Nigeria_Keyboard">OLPC Nigerian keyboard</a>. Pay attention to the "h" key. (The problem was that my "h" key thought it was a "u".)</p>
<p>A quick /etc/sysconfig/keyboard edit switching my keyboard layout permanently from Nigerian to United States (until I relearn dvorak) solves everything. I guess my old build before the <a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Activated_upgrade">activated upgrade</a> was set to US, and the activated upgrade... sets to Nigeria? In any case, "it's a feature, not a bug."</p>
<p>I can't believe I've never dug around this stuff before. I was always a wuss about breaking my computer (and other projects), so I never got the sheer amount of bug-fixing experiences most hackers seem to have cut their teeth on. Trying... to... fix. MUST BREAK THINGS MORE. Or alternatively, help other folks whose things are broken... which is why I think I learn more doing tech support and teaching than I would futzing about on my own. Instead of feeling guilty for wasting other people's time, I feel good that I'm helping someone else. (Yes, I'm aware this logic is erroneous. I am apparently not the average hacker, if there is such a thing.)</p>
<p>In other news, I think I'm getting pretty good at getting other people to hack. After spending most of the day in the Chinese consulate waiting for my dad's visa (last-minute work emergency for him; unexpected day-of-unproductivity for me) my mom and I went to the OLPC Chicago meetup at Google, which had (if I counted nametags right) over 50 people. A week earlier I'd expected maybe 30 to RSVP, tops.</p>
<p>Things went phenomenally well (thanks to all the attendees, not my lack of meeting-holding-skillz; everyone pretty much organized themselves) - but I won't talk about it here just yet, because I promised Seth I'd save my report for the 'zine issue coming out soon. Now if I can just attend events that I'm <em>not</em> running and actually get some hacking of my own done... (I really want to go to <a href="http://us.pycon.org/2008/about/">PyCon</a>, but I'll be in New York while all the awesomeness is happening, including Mike's <a href="http://us.pycon.org/2008/tutorials/SugarFletcher/">Sugar tutorial</a>.)</p>
<p>I've been sleeping on a mattress in the corner of my parents' room for the past few nights because it is Damn Cold here and my room gets a feeble trickle of lukewarm air from the heater, which (plus thick fuzzy blankets) is Not Enough. Especially since I still have to prop myself up on 4 pillows and cough for an hour before I'm able to conk out. On the other hand, this counts as Getting Better. So I am satisfied.</p>
