<p>Wow. Sleeping with a good pillow makes a tremendous difference to how well you can <em>stay</em> asleep. I may have found the cause of my mysterious "why have I needed 7-8 hours of sleep the last few weeks?" puzzle. Will wait a few more days before passing final judgment on this one, but <em>wow.</em></p>
<p>Sometimes, when I'm reading the blogs of my friends, they'll write something that's just so... much... <em>them</em> - there's a brief flash of their presence as I read, and then it goes <em>poof! </em>and I go on with life a little happier for having had that.</p>
<p>I went home to Chicago this weekend for my dad's 50th birthday. It's nice to briefly stay in a huge house with a big kitchen with a dishwasher. (It's almost like living in a restaurant! You don't have to scrub your plates, you just <em>put</em> them there and then they're <em>clean</em>!*) Also, even after 22 years, my parents happily surprise me sometimes.</p>
<p>*I am easily excited.</p>
<p>Someday I will have to sew up this big hole in my backpack. Someday I will have to learn to sew. Someday I will borrow a needle and thread from someone else to do so. In the meantime, nothing's fallen out yet.</p>
<p>Fried spinach is delicious. Retro kitchen appliances can be extraordinarily ugly (also, pink bathrooms from the 60's? Eugh). Clothes irons are more expensive than anticipated. I miss the piano in my parents' house. Leaky gel pens make interesting - what is the handwriting equivalent of a typo? Ooh, clock radio. Why is there a drawing of a watermelon here? I'm thirsty. The potentiometer controlling this ceiling fan has a crooked plate behind it. I wonder if my brother actually needs two saxophones. What happened to my toothpaste?</p>
<p>Oh god, my mind is turning into the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random">Random Article link</a> on Wikipedia. I really really need to go to bed.</p>
