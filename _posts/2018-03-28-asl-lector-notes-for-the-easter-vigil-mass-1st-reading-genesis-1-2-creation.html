<p>It is Holy Week, one of my favorite weeks of the year. I have the privilege of signing the 1st reading for the Saturday Vigil Mass this year in Rochester, and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/17WM7PQdvYPSbZbpHg8KXH1vzQNC3x2ej3qh254hItlk/edit">I've posted my translation and performance notes</a> in case it might be useful to someone who wonders about the translation process (which I've written about elsewhere: <a href="http://blog.melchua.com/2018/03/28/mass-lector-prep-notes-part-1/">part 1</a> and <a href="http://blog.melchua.com/2018/03/28/mass-lector-prep-notes-part-2/">part 2</a>).</p>
<p>The first reading (long version) is most of Genesis 1-2, or the (Yahwist) Creation story. I inadvertently wrote my notes so that they will (hopefully) make sense to both signers and non-signers -- I hope this will be useful to my non-signing friends as an explanation of what it's like (for me) to think in ASL. Basically, the left column is the English translation, and then the middle column is me trying to describe the images that come to mind when I read it.</p>
<p>This isn’t analysis of any sort, it’s not translation, it’s… what is the movie in my mind, right now, when I read through these words? The short version is that God is a lot like a really excited 5-year-old, because… I’m the one signing this, and I'm a lot like a really excited 5-year-old.</p>
<p>After the imagery description in the middle column, another round through the reading follows on the right, with the gloss (as best as I can capture it) for what I sign during the Vigil Mass. I wrote most of this post while I was preparing to lector for the Boston Deaf Catholic Vigil Mass last year (2017). At the time, I still felt really awkward, shy, and hesitant while signing; my expressive usage of the language was very new and limited, and I'd never worked or lived among other Deaf people or otherwise had much of a cultural/linguistic immersion. Vigil Mass 2017 was a linguistic/spiritual/identity landmark for me; it was the first time I felt like I was expressing exactly what I was trying to express in ASL. Which… was a huge deal for me, as a hesitant new signer (thanks, growing up oral).</p>
<p>Thanks to Deacon Patrick Graybill for last-minute feedback on Holy Thursday 2017, and to God for… well, basically… everything, right? That’s what this reading is all about.</p>
