<p>Something I wrote 2 years ago, in January 2007, when someone asked for thoughts on how to design technologies for another culture - with the big disclaimer (then and now) that I Didn't Know What I Was Talking About.</p>
<ol>
<blockquote></blockquote>
<li> Learn as much as you can about your domain (in most of our cases, engineering) and their culture and needs before you get there through any means possible.</li>
<li>Upon arriving, totally ignore this prior knowledge (empty your cup).</li>
<li>Once you've learned how and why they do it, and appreciate it as a totally logical, intelligent, valuable approach (not in bemusement at their "lesser techniques," because they aren't), <em>then</em> you start slowly bringing in your domain expertise and sharing things back with them.</li>
</ol>
<p>And my favorite response (from someone else), foreshadowing the many "curriculum as culture" and "bahasa geek translator" moments I'd have later that year:</p>
<blockquote><p>I believe that one of the most important skills to have when approaching complex problems is the ability to bridge languages.  A "language," in this sense, is more than just a set of terminologies and jargons or even a particular spoken language... it's a way of thinking...  We can't be expected to learn all the different ways of seeing a problem, of course.  I wonder if the next best thing is to find people in our communities with those language-bridging skills and nuture what ambassadorial traits we happen to have within ourselves</p></blockquote>
