<p>Blast from the past came up in #teachingopensource today, and I continue to search for a dissertation project Just As Cool for my own studies. I salute you, sir.</p>
<p>Also, this quote still holds true.</p>
<blockquote><p>"...the exact technologies that are in use at any particular point in<br />
time don’t matter as much as the fact that it is people being connected<br />
through them. Tools come and go constantly, and the only constant is<br />
that the people are the important part of the equation." --D'Arcy Norman</p></blockquote>
