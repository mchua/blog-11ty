<p>I am sometimes extraordinarily bad at sleeping. Sometimes this happens when I think too much.</p>
<p>I have also started praying for miracles again (although in another sense, I never really stopped). Sometimes it works. You never know. Worked for me 7 years ago, 10 years ago, 20 years ago (on my behalf, as I was too little to know what "praying" meant at the time). Might work again.</p>
<p>That last bit isn't <i>quite</i> right; the phrasing seems to imply some kind of Deus Ex Machina deigning to grant a human's wish. I think the real miracles - and these happen every day - happen <i>inside</i> people. Things happen. Sometimes we can't change them. But we <i>can</i> decide how we're going to react, what we're going to do about it - so the thing to ask for becomes, as the old prayer goes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Grant me the serenity<br />To accept the things I cannot change;<br />The courage to change the things that I can;<br />And the wisdom to know the difference.</p></blockquote>
<p>I tend to view the world as hackable. There are <i>plenty</i> of things in the world that can be changed. The flip side of this is that my serenity is often lacking. Like I said, sometimes I think too much. Sometimes this makes me sleep too little. But I believe that prayers do get heard, and that they're answered - sometimes not in the way that you were hoping for, but always in the way they ought to be.</p>
<p>This post may be an indication that it's time for me to go to bed. Soon. I want to finish reading first.</p>
