<p><em>It's usually due on Friday, but we're all sending it in a day early this week.</em></p>
<p>Mel joined the team full-time as a Support/QA engineer on Monday and  tries to keep a daily log for the general public at  <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="../category/olpc/">http://blog.melchua.com/category/olpc/</a>. This week was spent catching up  and testing 8.2-760, mostly with connectivity and verifying that  upgrading from builds out in the field (656, 703, 708) doesn't break  things in horrible ways.</p>
<p>Currently working on verifying/closing fixed blockers in  <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://dev.laptop.org/report/33">http://dev.laptop.org/report/33</a>, making a procedure to test memory  leaks, and finding a way to easily get test case  coverage/completion/pass stats as we work with Kim's new test case  management/results reporting system. Also writing reports in fragmented  third-person sentences.</p>
