<p>I love going through old notebooks. There's a wonderfully cleansing feeling to it, a way of revisiting the past so you can let it go and move on with it. I'm working through my entire stack of backlogged notebooks (3 down, 5 to go). Expect a flurry of posts today as those come out.</p>
<p>From this summer in Boston:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Dreamt I was an electrical component. Dreamt of impedance mismatch." (from the "this no longer makes sense to me out of context" department)</li>
<li>"Do not build semantics into the... game! Instead, tubify it." (What?)</li>
<li>"I can't read lips because of the @!#_; mike." (notes from a Wikimania speech)</li>
</ul>
<p>From my notebook in the Philippines, a short collection of moments.</p>
<ul>
<li>the bus swerving repeatedly into opposing traffic, passing five cars, then slamming back into the right lane inches before a certain-death collision with a bus coming in the opposite direction doing Exactly The Same Thing (it was the best cardiovascular workout I've ever gotten from public transportation)</li>
<li>a roadside kiosk named SHINNY BUBBLES VIDEOKE [sic]</li>
<li>raking rice to dry on the driveway, on basketball courts, on the roadside... carpets of tiny brown grains everywhere, dogs and small children occasionally running across them (now I know why people wash their rice).</li>
<li>goats and chicken grazing in a barbed-wire-fenced yard next to a shed of men welding together bright orange hand mixers for cement.</li>
<li>a billboard for PLACENTA beauty-care product (yes, it contains real placenta). Same billboard being used as a clothes hanger for the shanties built around it; there's something incongruous about the beaming face of a white-skinned, larger-than-life model surrounded by flapping faded clothes on cheap plastic hangers. </li>
<li>tall, white-tufted fields of grass with white cattle roaming placidly within them.</li>
<li>"vulcanising shops" advertised by tires nailed to the doorway with white-painted letters around their rim.</li>
<li>a mesh hammock hung underneath the undercarriage of a truck parked by the side of the road, with a barefoot, long-legged man snoozing in it, head barely clearing the rear axle by a few inches.</li>
<li>a little shrine to the Virgin Mary carefully shielded by a ragged umbrella that used to advertise hot dogs</li>
</ul>
<p>This isn't a bad way to spend an Easter afternoon, actually. I might not get that Trac plugin started, but I've found that deliberate procrastination is my friend - when I "decide" to do something (which isn't actually under some deadline I have to meet), I usually end up not-doing it, but doing something even better/cooler (in my eyes). So the original activity becomes a bar of "productivity" over which whatever actual action replaces it has to climb.</p>
