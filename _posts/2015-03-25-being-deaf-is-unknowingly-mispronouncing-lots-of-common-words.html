<p>Since I am deaf, most of my native-language (English) vocabulary comes from books. Consequently, I can walk around pronouncing words incorrectly for <em>years </em>before someone says something. A small selection, in chronological order.</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">Vegetable, elementary school. ("veg-eh-tay-bull," as if I were pronouncing "table" like the piece of furniture.)</span></li>
<li>Pythagorean, 6th grade. (To be fair, my Filipino-born parents also pronounce it "PITH-a-GORE-ee-yan theorem.")</li>
<li>Supremacist(s), 8th grade. (I gave a history presentation that mentioned the "Nazi Super-masses.")</li>
<li>Chef, Champagne, and all other French words beginning in 'ch', age 26. ("The Sheff chose a great shampain to pair with this food.")</li>
<li>Scheme, last week (one of my favorite CS textbooks is "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Little-Schemer-4th-Edition/dp/0262560992">The Little Sheemer.</a>" Sadly, this means I have been butchering the title since age 19 when I first encountered it.)</li>
<li>Aggrandizing, yesterday (this was pronounced correctly, but with the wrong syllabic stress: I guessed "aggranDIzing," but it's "agGRANDizing.")</li>
</ol>
<p>Friends, if you remember other amusing "Mel mangles her native language!" moments, let me know. I'm collecting these.</p>
