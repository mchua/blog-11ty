<p>Because sometimes my friends are ridiculous: Gui and Jenn are getting married, and...</p>
<blockquote><p><span>They started thinking, and Gui had a crazy idea. He was dreaming big, and asked Jenn "what if we dreamed the biggest we could dream, and got the legendary Bluesman Buddy Guy to sing for our dance after the wedding?" She looked at him, incredulous - he just graduated from college and she works in theater. There's no way in hell they could afford it, and she said so.</span><br />
<span> </span><br />
<span>He looked back and grinned, and said "It's true, but damn if we shouldn't just go ahead and ask!"</span><br />
<span> </span><br />
<span>And thus this video, where he asks Buddy Guy in a song.</span></p></blockquote>

<p>The ending lyrics: (Gui got Jenn's ring size by measuring her finger with a caliper while she was sleeping.)</p>
<blockquote><p>Well she don't wear much jewelry<br />
And she ain't got no rings<br />
I had to get myself a ruler<br />
Measure her finger as she sleeps<br />
Oh come on!<br />
Oh baby please marry me<br />
Oh we'll tie the knot with a dance<br />
And have us a juke joint Blues wedding</p>
<p>Well she told me yes<br />
By screaming her reply<br />
We started talkin wedding singers<br />
I said lets get Buddy Guy!<br />
She said what now?<br />
Boy what the hell you on?<br />
I said you don't know till you ask<br />
And baby I don't dream small</p>
<p>Well hear us Buddy Guy<br />
We await your reply<br />
Could you please just take a minute<br />
To help us keep the Blues alive<br />
Well come on!<br />
All we need's a little news<br />
Oh won't you help us, Buddy Guy<br />
We got these too-poor-for-a-Blues-singer Blues</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, I think we always knew this was going to be one heck of an epic wedding.</p>
