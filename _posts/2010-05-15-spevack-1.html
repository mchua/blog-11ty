<p>I'm pretty sure I've linked to this before, but the poem <a href="http://www.northnode.org/poem.htm">"To be of use"</a> by Marge Piercy describes a lot of what I like about my team at Red Hat. And... actually, many of my friends and colleagues, no matter where they're from.</p>
<blockquote><p>The people I love the best<br />jump into work head first<br />without dallying in the shallows<br />and swim off with sure strokes almost out of sight.</p></blockquote>
<p>I <a href="http://spevack.livejournal.com/104937.html">agree with Max</a>: <a href="http://gregdekspeaks.wordpress.com/">Greg's</a> going to kick ass at <a href="http://www.iskme.org/">ISKME</a>. Although I've only known (and looked up to) him for a short period of time compared with others in Fedora and Red Hat and beyond who've worked with Greg for many years, it's been an honor to work with and learn from him - and I'm sure that, thanks to the collaborative-fu of the open education world (which both of us are still very much in), it's not going to stop here.</p>
<p>Good luck, Greg. We'll see you around.</p>
