<p>Today, I...
<ul>
<li>Registered for OSCON - giving two talks now, one on "Junior Jobs and Bite-sized Bugs: Entry Points for New Contributors to Open Source" with Asheesh Laroia of OpenHatch, and another on "5 FOSS in Edu Projects that Changed the World" with my Red Hat teammate Karsten Wade. Mild terror at such high-profile speaking opportunities. Ridiculous amounts of planning and rehearsal. Rehearsal. <i>Rehearsal.</i> I can improv by myself, but with someone else? I don't know.</li>
<li>Found to my astonishment that I actually <i>do</i> understand our education strategy and... almost feel on top of things! Whoa!</li>
<li>Went drinking with Max and Greg after Greg's surprise farewell party. I may periodically need to visit Greg's house and bribe bribe him with liquor in exchange for advice.</li>
<li>Earned my first One American Dollar from a dare posed by Max. In other news, I've whiteboard-staked my claim to Greg's desk.</li>
<li>Got hit by the truck of reality again (I freakin' <i>hate</i> that stupid truck).</li>
<li>Discovered late-night restaurants in Raleigh. Well, one of them, anyway - they have good matzo ball soup.</li>
<li>Got details together for applying for an apartment near the office for the fall; I'll submit the application tomorrow. Plans are getting more and more solid every day. It feels good, yet sort of weird, to know that I'll be living in one place for almost a whole year. By my standards, that's <i>extreme</i> stability - even if I'm sure I'll be traveling a lot during that time.</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't know what I'm doing Saturday morning. I don't think I have anything to do, and I am guessing that everyone I know here (from work) will be busy. I think... I might just wander the city, and see if I can figure out the sorts of things I might do once I move down here in August. I really need to figure out how to make sure I don't just work.</p>
