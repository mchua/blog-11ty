<p>Geeks crashing after hackathons.</p>
<p>The ways in which people crash when they're utterly exhausted after a long work sprint are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Inventive - where do they sleep? what do they sleep on? how do they block out light and sound? what do they use for blankets?</li>
<li>Informative - you learn a lot about someone by seeing what drives them to stay up past their bedtime</li>
<li>Touching - this most of all. Sleeping hackers remind me a little bit of sleeping children. They fall asleep so full of dreams.</li>
</ol>
