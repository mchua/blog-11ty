<p><em>High-level reading note summaries, in ongoing experiments to make intermediate products of my work more accessible/useful to others.</em></p>
<p>This book was authored by William G. Tierney and Estela Mara Bensimon. Worth reading if you're interested in faculty socialization and/or the promotion/tenure process and how it can be situated in history and critically assessed. The book draws from stories about the hiring, tenure, and promotion process as told by new faculty.</p>
<p>Tierney and Bensimon point to many inconsistencies and gaps in the faculty hiring/promotion experience. They're not necessarily bad inconsistencies or gaps, but seeing that they're there lets us make decisions about what to do with them. For instance, what should happen between hiring and campus arrival -- is it an issue that this space is often scattered and chaotic?</p>
<p>The book also has a chapter devoted to gender, and another chapter devoted to race and ethnicity, as particular factors that impact faculty socialization into academe. If you're looking at gender, race, and/or ethnicity, those chapters are full of good stories situated in the early-professor life.</p>
<p>It ends with a section on what colleges and universities can do, so the last chapter is worth revisiting or reading if you're involved in the hiring/promotion process in your institution. For instance, it recommends adopting (what I'd call) a user-centered experience design perspective on the faculty hiring perspective. For instance, instead of only considering what the campus needs to learn about candidates when they visit, also consider how candidates experience your interview process -- and how you would you like them to.</p>
