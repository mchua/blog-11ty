<p><em>From an email I wrote recently to a friend, who subsequently asked me to post these passages on my blog so she could share them with others.</em></p>
<p>I think a lot of the things and behaviours that make an open source community work are also applicable to dating, if that makes any sense at all.</p>
<p>Aspiring to radical realtime transparency but knowing you'll fall short, having a rhythm, working to become a better hacker and help others become better hackers themselves, even if you're different types of contributors or working through different processes or on different projects for a while. Clarification, getting things out on the table. The willingness to waste time experimenting because you know it's not actually wasted time at all, just a process with long-term and unpredictable results.</p>
<p>My boyfriend uses the phrase "beautiful awkwardness" to describe the feeling you get sometimes when you're sitting in the uncomfortable spot in the relationship domain specifically -- but if you're lucky, there's someone you're sitting with, together. And maybe that's how you can tell. I dunno, I've never done this before. But if you're comfortable enough with someone else that you can be uncomfortable together, then... that means something, I think.</p>
