<p><a href="http://sachachua.com/wp/2008/12/02/one-of-canadas-most-influential-women-in-social-media/">Go Sacha!</a> The biggest reason I'm inspired by this post of hers is not that she was nominated, but her description of how she wants to grow into it.</p>
<p>Inbox cleaning is really a project made for long sprints of focused time. I probably cleared 200+ emails today, but got most of the 200 today - hence the apparent lack of visible progress. I did reply to every email that's come in before I left for Thanksgiving vacation, and get below 150 emails (my two goals on that for the night). So that's good.</p>
<p>I did not write my book chapter proposal. I am a bad panda. I will write it while waiting in the doctor's office tomorrow morning. I'm also horribly behind on <a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/User:Mchua/Weekly_updates/2008-12-05">everything else</a>; what doesn't get done tomorrow is going to be marked <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Bug_Status_WONTFIX">wontfix</a>; I will allow myself one "later." There. That clears up Friday for a hacking day for me.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0379786/quotes">I am a leaf on the wind. Watch how I soar.</a> Through class-5 hurricanes. For certain values of "soar" to be defined at a later date as "the way I am currently tumbling through space."</p>
