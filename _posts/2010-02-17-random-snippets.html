<p>Braindumping in Toronto (still alive!) from the past few days before I conk out.</p>
<p>Random moments in the past few days:
<ol>
<li>Fresh. Eggs. Ahhhhhhhh.</li>
<li>Decompressing on Monday night - I didn't pre-freak-out before CSH and felt pretty calm during it (honestly, I had no <i>time</i> to be terrified), but towards the end when I was starting to come to myself again, I looked down and noticed my hand was shaking. "Oh," I thought. "My mind has calmed itself down by detaching, but I actually need to decompress from this AUGH I TALKED IN FRONT OF PEOPLE AUGH" thing. Proceeded to go for a long drive after CSH - nothing like city driving in the dark while singing Coldplay and Snow Patrol and Billie Holiday to calm you down again. (It does get better each time; every time I do a session, I rewire the part of my brain that's been made to think I'm not <i>supposed </i>to display knowledge of stuff.)</li>
<li>Running the Fedora Marketing meeting from Sesame Street. <a href="http://www.museumofplay.org/things_to_see/sesame_street.html">I kid you not. </a></li>
</ol>
<p>Longer posts to make at some point:
<ol>
<li>Remainder of CSH presentation</li>
<li>The coloring book analogy for FOSS co-ops</li>
<li>Why FOSS Students Should Stay In School (inspired by Bert's post)</li>
<li>...and then a bunch of opensource.com posts that are going to... there's a queue growing, we need to dump the queue to some "post ideas" wiki page and just start writing them.</li>
</ol>
<p>Things I don't want to forget:</p>
<ol>
<li>Another CFS SoaS&nbsp; blogger - <a href="http://melispeaks.wordpress.com/2010/02/14/cfs-soas-laptops/">Melanie Kim, deployment support.</a> Coming soon to a <a href="http://planet.sugarlabs.org">Planet Sugar Labs</a> near you. ;-)</li>
<li>To do SoaS testing for the CFS deployment.</li>
<li>To clean up Marketing meeting notes and attack the F13 talking points.</li>
<li>To do POSSE pings and catch up on tickets and a few short-draft emails I was supposed to writel</li>
<li>To sleep</li>
</ol>
<p>With that in mind, I'm going to plant facedown in my pillow now.</p>
