<p>I will be in LA with Nikki for a week and consequently probably <i>very</i> slow to respond to email, and otherwise not-really-on-the-interwebs-that-much. (Prediction: withdrawal symptoms will be severe.)</p>
<p>In the meantime, food for thought.</p>
<p>Anyone that works on a team with absolutely brilliant people needs to read about <a href="http://www.teamtechnology.co.uk/tt/t-articl/apollo.htm">apollo syndrome</a>. I need to find a better resource on it. Basically, I've found that throwing a lot of smart people at a problem does not magically guarantee that problem will be solved; you've still got to figure out - as a group - how you are going to work together.</p>
