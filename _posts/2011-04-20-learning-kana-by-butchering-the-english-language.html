<p>I was recently asked how I learned the Japanese writing system. Actually, there are three: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiragana">hiragana</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katakana">katakana</a>, which are phonetic systems, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanji">kanji</a> , which are basically  Chinese characters embedded into Japanese text and pronounced as  Japanese words.</p>
<p>The answer was that I was <i>really</i> bored the summer before I started high school, and had no qualms about butchering the English or Japanese languages. I'd also recently read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladle_Rat_Rotten_Hut">Ladle Rat Rotten Hut</a> - so when I pulled out Japanese stuff from my local library, I went "wait, these are <i>phonetic</i> systems... they're just different ways of writing sounds." So I happily started writing English sentences in the Japanese phonetic writing system.</p>
<p>For instance, a <a href="http://www.nationalcenter.org/PaulRevere%27sRide.html">poem</a> beginning:</p>
<blockquote><p>Listen my children and you shall hear<br />Of the midnight ride of Paul Revere</p></blockquote>
<p>Becomes...</p>
<blockquote><p>りすてん まい ちゅづれぬ あん ゆ しゃる ひる<br /><i>li-su-te-n ma-i chu-du-re-nu a-n yu sha-ru hi-ru</i></p>
<p>おぷ で みづないっと らいど おぷ ぱいる れびる<br /><i>o-pu de mi-du-na-i-t-to ra-i-do o-pu pa-i-ru re-bi-ru</i></p></blockquote>
<p>...and so forth.</p>
<p>Basically, I learned kana as an alternative phonetic system with which to write English, then switching to use the same phonetic system to write Japanese once I had it down. (I never did build up a good Japanese word vocabulary - but I can still read and write kana fluently to this day. I just don't know what the words I'm saying <i>mean</i>.)</p>
<p>Kanji, on the other hand, I never did find a good way to learn. It helps to think in terms of breaking characters down into radicals, but beyond that you just have to memorize each one, as far as I know. I did learn that studying Chinese and Japanese back-to-back is a bad idea, though; to this day, when I'm reading Chinese, sometimes the Japanese pronunciation of a word will pop out in the middle, confusing the heck out of everyone - and the reverse happens as well. I still haven't figured out a way to learn grammar, either. But that's what further explorations are for.</p>
