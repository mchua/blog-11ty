<p>This week's schedule has been a magnificent combination of:
<ol>
<li>"Oh man, I spent the last week in Raleigh and need to catch up on my massive email backlog now"</li>
<li>A good number of my friends graduating and wanting to see me RIGHT NOW before they LEAVE BOSTON</li>
<li>The return of the cough, which makes me sleep far earlier and more than usual (I <i>hate</i> being just mildly sick)</li>
<li>A bunch of Boston-area meetings for Red Hat stuff (POSSE, SCOPE, blah blah blah) that all need to happen in the next 3 days in between all the rest of this</li>
<li>Etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>I've schedule-shifted to be an early sleeper and riser since 12 days ago when I went out to Florida to hang out with Andrew. I suspect it will shift back this weekend when I'm in California for my cousin's wedding, but while I have it, I will take advantage of the early-morning productivity time (hypothetically).</p>
<p>Prioritization! I can haz it?</p>
