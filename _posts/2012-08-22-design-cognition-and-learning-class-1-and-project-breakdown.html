<p>Liveblogging Robin's first "Design, Cognition, and Learning" class of the semester, where she is asking us what we think of when we think about "design." We start out pretty tame: complexity, iteration, creativity. More words pop out: aesthetic, perspective, conflict, change. Videogames (a wave of laughter at this one).</p>
<p>We break into pairs and tell each other stories about a design experience we had; what lessons did we learn from that particular experience? Francesca and I talk about the go-cart she built when she was 9, and the <a href="http://craftofelectronics.org">Craft of Electronics</a> course design adventure from this summer. Our list:</p>
<ul>
<li>how hard it is to kill sacred cows even if you know they hurt progress towards your goal</li>
<li>the impact of not having a dedicated design space</li>
<li>how little time professors usually have for course design</li>
<li>discovery of the iterative nature of design</li>
<li>the effect of unlimited supplies (living next to a workshop/warehouse)</li>
<li>emergent nature of the design process - coming up with a direction as you go and that aspect of creativity (instead of having a set design in the beginning)</li>
<li>how helpful minimal but useful guidance can be (both aspects are important)</li>
</ul>
<p>The class discussion spins outwards from there, but I'll segue into another topic here: ADHD brain pre-emptiveness. I now know the due dates of our major projects for the term. What if I outline, step-by-step, the things I should do for each assignment during the weeks I've got to do it, taking into account things like conferences and quals? That way, I know that each week I need to do my weekly readings and reflections, and maybe I'll... actually do them.</p>
<p>There are 3 projects in the class, and I'm already thinking forward to what I'm going to do with them. The first is the "Design As X" project, where we're supposed to pick a perspective on design (human-centered, sustainable, participatory, etc) and do a paper and a poster on it. Off the top of my head, I'm interested in collaboration, especially participatory stuff that dives off the deep end -- poststructuralist, boundary-blurring things that are about inclusion, not about super-structured, set-roster teams. I'll need to talk with Robin about where I can go with that; there's both too much and too little to read, but I think I want to go into Patti Lather's stuff for ths if I can, somehow.</p>
<p><strong>Master Plan for Design As X - 6 weeks (the first one is this week)</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>look at Dr. Lather's biblio, write summary suggestion &amp; ask Robin for ideas</li>
<li>finalize topic, pick core reading (1-2), read it and take notes</li>
<li>finish reading and taking notes on core reading; create paper outline</li>
<li>pull notes into paper outline; create poster outline</li>
<li>polish paper (think about Framework dataset)</li>
<li>polish poster (choose final Framework dataset)</li>
</ol>
<p>Next is the "design learning pattern" project, a structured literature review where we are handed an overview paper, pick one of the ideas it discusses, and fan out into its citations. I can do that, even if I don't know what the design learning patterns are. Then there's also a small research project where we need to analyze data using a design framework of our choosing. I think, briefly, of using this as a good excuse for a <a href="http://berea.edu">Berea</a> trip, because I'd love to see <a href="http://jadud.com">Matt</a> and <a href="http://craftofelectronics.org">CraftOE</a> again, and then I realize this assignment will be running during the time I'm doing my readiness assessment (ENE's equivalent of quals) and any ambition flies out the window.</p>
<p><strong>Master Plan for Learning pattern lit review - 2 weeks</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>pick pattern and readings (2 citations from paper); read and take notes; create paper outline</li>
<li>pull notes into paper outline; polish paper (choose Framework framework, get readings)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Frameworks - 3 weeks (warning: SIMULTANEOUS WITH QUALS! Which is why I've tried to pull it into the earlier weeks as well.)</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>read and take notes on framework readings; design data analysis codeset</li>
<li>analyze data, write up a summary of themes &amp; outline final deliverable format</li>
<li>pull information into outline; create final deliverable</li>
</ol>
<p>Actually, that all sounds pretty good to me.</p>
