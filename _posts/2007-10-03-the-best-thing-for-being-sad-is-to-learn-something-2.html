<p>News flash: loneliness does take hold when you're on the other side of the world from the majority of people you know and the culture you grew up in and the language you speak (and I don't just mean English - I mean American Hacker English).</p>
<p>Fortunately, I have a lot to catch up on and learn. My current mode is "dah! I want to write and write and write!" so that's what I'll do.</p>
