<p>I don't usually post (1) short snippets or (2) about current sporting events, but <a href="http://wordshack.wordpress.com/">Robyn Bergeron's</a> note was impossible to pass up:</p>
<blockquote><p>I have decided that the <a href="http://teachingopensource.org/index.php/POSSE">POSSE owl</a> should be named Superb Owl. So that he can have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl">one day a year</a> dedicated to him.</p></blockquote>
<p>(Note that the POSSE owl is not necessarily a male owl, and that my posting of Robyn's quote does not constitute my endorsement of such a name for said owl. Still, it made me <a href="http://www.funnyqanda.com/images/sense-this-picture-makes-none.jpg">stammer incoherently</a> for a moment. Thank you, Robyn.)</p>
<p>That is all. Have a very good evening, and may your <a href="http://www.timesnews.net/article/9041863/super-bowl-sunday-ranks-second-only-to-thanksgiving-for-eating-in-us">nacho overdoses</a> be <a href="http://beefymiracle.org/">miraculously</a> healed with a good night's sleep.</p>
