<p><em>As part of the "make disability stuff visible" thing I am trying to do, here is an update I just sent some of the staff at </em><em>Purdue's DRC (Disability Resource Center). First, a little explanation/setup.</em></p>
<p><strong>SETTING THE SCENE</strong></p>
<p>I'm deaf*, and need interpreters/transcribers to be able to understand lectures, participate in group discussions, etc. Since interpreters/transcribers also need to be booked in advance, I can't simply schedule an impromptu meeting, add a class, etc. like my classmates. I also need to also arrange for accessibility for it, and sometimes it's touch-and-go. If I want accessibility, I constantly need to juggle these logistics with no assurance that the other end (teachers, events, etc.) will remember, follow up on things, etc. I can never tell how long it will take, so I can't budget or plan for it -- one email? Ten emails back and forth? Five emails and a meeting? Seven emails, and then they forget to set it up on the day of the class? Eight emails, and then I have to go through the humiliation of asking a friend to make phone calls for me, because sometimes they don't reply to my emails, but they <em>will </em>respond right away to a hearing person calling them on the phone?</p>
<p>It's no wonder I <em>hate</em> logistics with a passion; imagine being a kid and having <em>this -- </em>not things like "organize your Boy Scout troop's hike!" -- be your first, primary, and repeated exposure to "doing logistics." I wish I had enough money to hire someone to just <em>do </em>this for me, but... seriously, how many people have the sort of economic privilege needed to hire a personal assistant? (Personal assistants get paid more than I do as a grad student!)</p>
<p>Anyway, that's why I'm so grateful to have such a great DRC counselor at Purdue, because that's what their job is -- to be the people who taks this stuff off my shoulders. It took a while, but I'm now at the point where I completely trust my counselor to pick up on things when I ask for them once, and to do what needs to be done to make them happen (especially when the other party is nonresponsive). It makes the cost predictable -- I email the DRC once, and things happen -- and since I know and have bounds on how much effort it will take, I actually <em>do </em>it, and now I'm participating in classes instead of just faking my way through them.</p>
<p><em>And with that, the email to my counselor is below.</em></p>
<p>Update on all things Mel-accessibility related, for your convenience.</p>
<p><strong>OLD STUFF, NO ACTION NEEDED</strong></p>
<p>1) Thursday afternoon meetings/seminars are being worked out with Voc Rehab, all set here.</p>
<p><strong>OLD STUFF, ACTION NEEDED (HELP PLEASE!)</strong></p>
<p>2) FIE (October conference in Madrid) has not responded at all to my requests. I think I'm gonna need some firepower here; can someone call them and be annoying 'till we get somewhere? I have sent them what I need, have contact info for a interpreter who's familiar with my discipline's material and is willing to go, etc. etc. -- we just need them to acknowledge this and say yes and figure out who will pay for it.</p>
<p><strong>NEW STUFF, ACTION NEEDED</strong></p>
<p>3) I'll be guest-teaching a colleague's class on September 25 (Thursday) from 10:30-11:20 in [location]. His students are going to be asking me tons of questions. Can we get CART/ASL?</p>
<p>4) I got a new RAship! [Purdue Department] hired me to do faculty development (...of sorts) for the professors doing the first Big Pedagogical Experiment. I think I'll be ok with 1:1 convos, but it sounds like there will be Big Meetings With Everybody (that they have not scheduled yet) and I am thinking "oh man, I am going to need an interpreter or CART or something for this, or my brain is going to fry." Can we make this happen, once I figure out when/where those meetings will be?</p>
<p><strong>UPCOMING STUFF, NO ACTION NEEDED (YET)</strong></p>
<p>5) I'll be registering for the POD conference in Dallas in November pretty soon, and am going to do the accessibility ask to them; I think it's their responsibility to take care of it, but just sending a heads-up in case we need to loop you into the convo for any reason (like the "hey, can you be really annoyingly persistent?" thing we need to do for FIE now).</p>
<p>6) The Faculty Coaching Seminar I mentioned earlier and signed up for is about to schedule my weekly check-in small group conference call, and I should have the schedule for that sometime next week so that we can arrange CART for it -- it'll be a regular weekly thing for all of Fall semester.</p>
<p>Thank you so much. You have no idea how much better you are making my life.</p>
<p><em></em><em>*A lot of people are surprised when they find out I'm deaf, or when they read these sorts of posts even if they already know I'm deaf. I speak and lipread so well that I can pass for hearing if I want to, so it looks like I am "doing fine by myself." It's a tremendous privilege and convenience to be able to pass, so </em><em>I spent most of my life passing, and still frequently do today -- but I would like to show people a little of how much it costs to do that, which is why I'm writing blog posts like this.</em></p>
