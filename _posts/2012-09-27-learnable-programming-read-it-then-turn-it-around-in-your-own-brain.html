<p>I'm cranking out my portfolio right now, so I'll just paste in a quick variant of the email I sent some friends.</p>
<p>This is long, but very worth reading: <a href="http://worrydream.com/LearnableProgramming/">Learnable Programming</a>. Think about it in the context of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learning and teaching introductory programming</li>
<li>Learning and teaching other technical classes that are code-related: digital signal processing, system dynamics.</li>
<li>Designing environments and languages for programming, especially when programming is "not the point" (as for an intro electronics or robotics course where the code is incidental to the final project)</li>
<li>Implications for MOOCS and massively distributed teaching systems in general.</li>
</ul>
<p>Don't blindly agree with it right away. I don't agree with everything; it's useful in some contexts and not others, etc. But it is a thoughtful, insightful, well-written piece that's worth looking at to see how someone thinks <em>well</em> about a difficult topic, and communicates it clearly.</p>
<p>Thanks to Diana Kimball for <a href="http://blog.dianakimball.com/post/32263101298">the post that led me to this article</a>, as well as for her insightful thoughts on <a href="http://blog.dianakimball.com/post/32263101298">taking a CS class at long last</a> as an MBA student.</p>
