<p>Tonight I was working on the sofa while Audrey (6 years old) was watching TV. Every time she shifted position, she edged a little closer until I looked up and noticed that my left arm was immobile because there was a Small Child leaning on it silently asking to be cuddled. So I pulled her into my lap enough that I could sling my left arm around her and continue typing from there while she kept on watching Cyber Chase.</p>
<p>I am a normal part of a little kid's life. I'm also acutely aware that she's not going to be little that much longer.</p>
