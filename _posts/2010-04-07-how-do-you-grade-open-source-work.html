<p>What things do you look at when evaluating student work on open source? I had to do this recently for an RIT team working on Sugar Labs Activities, and here's what I used:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Fortune_Hunter">the product</a>. As someone trying to be a user (rather than a developer) of their code, can I get their code and run it? Does it work for me?</li>
<li><a href="http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Fortune_Hunter">the project</a>. How's the wiki page and supporting documentation? Who wrote what? Does it pass the <a href="https://www.theopensourceway.org/wiki/How_to_tell_if_a_FLOSS_project_is_doomed_to_FAIL">FAILmeter</a>? What was the project plan - were milestones deliberately planned for and hit (and adjusted over time), or was this more improvisational? What kind of reflection on the project process has taken place?</li>
<li><a href="http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Fortune_Hunter/Education">design</a>. Since Sugar is an education project, it is important to the culture of the Sugar Labs community that all their work be designed to support learning - what kind of pedagogic thought has gone into this project? (In other communities, pedagogical design might be less important than something else, such as UI innovation, cross-platform compatibility, etc.)</li>
<li><a href="http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Fortune_Hunter/Developer%27s_Corner">developer docs</a>. As someone who might pick up on the code and try to extend it, can I quickly figure out how to do that - to go from running it to pushing up a patch?</li>
<li><a href="http://git.sugarlabs.org/projects/project-xavier">the code</a>. Who wrote which code when, and what did it do?</li>
<li><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/fortune-hunter">mailing list archives</a>. How did the team coordinate?</li>
<li><a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=MAFH">meeting logs</a>. (I had logs from lurking in-channel for the quarter, so I simply used those.) Who spoke? How did they interact? Did they bring any people from the community other than their immediate team in?</li>
<li><a href="http://mathfortunehunter.blogspot.com/">blog posts</a>. How did they present their work to an external audience? How did they phrase that conversation?</li>
</ul>
<p>What am I missing? What's extraneous? What are cues you look for, or quick tools/commands/pages you use to get an overall gauge that you can use to dive in for more detail on areas you should pay more attention to - what do you use as "should look at this more closely because it might be interesting" flags? (For instance,<a href="http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Special:Contributions"> Special:Contributions</a> makes it easy to look at one student's wiki work.)</p>
<p>How do you grade open source work?</p>
