<p>Speech/aural-rehab today continued our initial adventures in auditory discrimination. With my new hearing aids on, what sounds can I differentiate? I have a high-frequency hearing loss, so after a few initial checks to make sure I could perceive syllables, etc. we started to focus on fricatives, plosives, voiceless sounds, and high-frequency stuff in general.</p>
<p>Here's what I learned today.</p>
<p><strong>It can take 4-6 months for brain plasticity to adjust to having hearing aids.</strong> That's good to know. I have a finish line in sight; I know it's psychological, but having that end target does help me tolerate cognitive pain. I remarked wryly today that if it was like this with hearing aids alone, I was in no hurry to get cochlear implants (I'm a good candidate, though, so... I may yet someday walk through that door).</p>
<p><strong>The "ch" sound is actually the "t" sound placed at the beginning of the "sh" sound.</strong> Try it - say an extended "ch," then say an extended "sh." The only difference is the attack at the beginning.</p>
<p><strong>I can now hear the "sh" sound</strong> (it was inaudible before) and it is clear, unique, and distinct. In other words, where there was previously silence, there is a new sound that means "sh" and only "sh." Awesome. It's like having x-ray glasses. Gaining a superpower. Percieving what just wasn't there before.</p>
<p><strong>I can sometimes faintly hear the "t", "th," "p", "f", and "s" sounds, but they all sound identical.</strong> This only happens under excellent listening conditions; when I know I'm listening for them, when the room is quiet, etc... they show up, faintly, barely perceptibly. That's better than nothing; they were completely invisible in all conditions before! So I now have a new Mel-perceived sound, but it can mean one of three actual-sounds. This means I can't auditorily differentiate between "tin," "thin,"Â  "pin," "fin", and "sin" (but "shin" and "chin" are distinct from those five, though not from each other - see next item).</p>
<p><strong>I cannot distinguish between the "ch" and the "sh" sounds.</strong> If you combine the last 3 items, you'll see how this might logically follow.</p>
<p>It's a fun thing to debug. The item under test is basically my ear-brain system, which makes it both fascinating and frustrating -- fascinating because what we figure out affects so much of my life, frustrating because... it affects so much of my life.</p>
<p>I'm trying to push myself to keep my hearing aids on as much as possible for as long as possible -- how long can I keep them in my ears now? Okay, can I beat my previous record? Go, go, go! But it is energy-sapping. I'm grateful that I'm doing my interviews for qualitative research methods online, in text, where I can swim in a medium I'm fluent in, comfortable in, know people in... that's untouched and unscathed by my auditory hacking.</p>
<p>I guess we all need some solid ground to stand on, something that stays constant, a safe spot. Well, text is mine. Come to think of it, I've read more books in the 5 days since getting my hearing aids than for the... maybe 3 months prior. I wonder if I was looking for that place of familiarity and rest.</p>
<p>Tomorrow: writing, homework, reading, class, dancing, more speech, and time with friends, making sure I have buffer in the evening to fall over and breathe and rest in.</p>
