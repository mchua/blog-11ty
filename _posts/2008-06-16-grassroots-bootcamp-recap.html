<p>The first OLPC Grassroots Bootcamp ran last week at Boston at OLPC<br />
headquarters - thanks to all who attended, presented, and participated<br />
and helped us build community infrastructures, share best practices for<br />
grassroots movements, compile a list of <a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Grassroots_problems" title="Grassroots problems">Grassroots problems</a> to work on, flesh out a <a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Volunteering_process" title="Volunteering process">Volunteering process</a>, flesh out the role of a <a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Community_ambassador" title="Community ambassador">Community ambassador</a><br />
(or ambassadors), and - of course, the smaller moments... playing<br />
soccer, eating copious quantities of pizza, filling wall-to-wall<br />
whiteboards multiple times over with notes ranging from technical<br />
specifications to a request for parfaits, and just getting to know<br />
people from all walks of life and all corners of the world.</p>
<p>You can view notes and transcripts from each day at <a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Grassroots_bootcamp/Results" class="external free" title="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Grassroots_bootcamp/Results" rel="nofollow">http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Grassroots_bootcamp/Results</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection"></span><span class="mw-headline">Got notes from the bootcamp?</span></h3>
<p>If you attended the bootcamp, took photos, have notes, project<br />
files, or any other things from the past week, please post them on the<br />
wiki so all can see - a good place to put these is <a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Grassroots_bootcamp/Results" class="external free" title="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Grassroots_bootcamp/Results" rel="nofollow">http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Grassroots_bootcamp/Results</a>. We're particularly in need of notes from Thursday.</p>
<p><a name="Feedback_-_please_help_us_improve.21"></a><br />
<h3><span class="editsection"></span><span class="mw-headline">Feedback - please help us improve!</span></h3>
<p>If you're looking through the things we've posted and have<br />
suggestions for how we can clean up, clarify, and provide context<br />
behind some of the notes to make them more useful to others, please<br />
post them to the feedback page, <a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Grassroots_bootcamp/Feedback" class="external free" title="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Grassroots_bootcamp/Feedback" rel="nofollow">http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Grassroots_bootcamp/Feedback</a><br />
(or reply to me via email) and we'll do our best. There were plenty of<br />
bugs in the bootcamp process, as this was a rough first round - so<br />
feedback and suggestions for how to make a better bootcamp will be<br />
enthusiastically welcomed.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection"></span> <span class="mw-headline">Interested in running your own?</span></h3>
<p>Speaking of future bootcamps: One of the goals for this prototype<br />
bootcamp was to come up with a framework and resources such that other<br />
groups could run their own (better! localized!) grassroots training<br />
bootcamps in the future. Are there any groups out there interested in<br />
running/hosting a bootcamp of their own (preferably this summer)? We<br />
need some locations to help us figure out what resources we need to<br />
make available to help non-Bostonian bootcamps run, so please let us<br />
know if this something you'd be interested in helping us work out. It's<br />
much easier to build resources if you have someone particular in mind<br />
you're building them for, after all. See <a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Grassroots_bootcamp/Feedback#I.27m_interested_in_running_my_own_bootcamp" class="external free" title="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Grassroots_bootcamp/Feedback#I.27m_interested_in_running_my_own_bootcamp" rel="nofollow">http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Grassroots_bootcamp/Feedback#I.27m_interested_in_running_my_own_bootcamp</a>.</p>
<p>Cheers and thanks to all!</p>
