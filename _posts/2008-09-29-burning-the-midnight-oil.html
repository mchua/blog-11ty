<p><em>From 14 hours ago, when I was at the office (and had been for... oh, 6 hours, maybe.) I'm still at the office. Don't worry; I'm leaving for dinner soon.</em></p>
<p>It's half-past-two; I'm at the office, but I'm not the only one (Richard  is in his lab). I'm taking a writing break in between going through test  cases. I'm trying to read patches for the bugs I'm verifying as fixed to  see how, exactly, you'd solve that problem in code. Maybe half the  patches I read fall into the "Ok, I think I see how that works, but how  the blazes did you figure out to put the changes there and that you  needed to type that?" category. Then there are some that fall into the  "...and to fix this, they used a Magic Tool that is Undocumented  According To Google" category. I need to start making a note of those  black boxes so I can ask about them when we have some free time* after  this release goes out.</p>
<p>I can't overhear side convos that fly between the engineers who work  around me (I never have been able to), so this is my way of trying to  absorb the notion of "how things are done." That, and I read IRC channel  logs for as many OLPC-related channels as I can, as close to every day  as I can, and attempt to piece together fragments of the conversations  there into some sort of "I should learn from this" thing. Tentatively, slowly, I'm starting to ask questions. (I am <em>very </em>shy. The hyperactivity just occasionally looks like chutzpah.)</p>
<p>*free time? At 1cc? I swear we have... some of that... sometimes...</p>
<p>The nice thing about concentrating on absorbing is that you don't have  to worry about learning too many things at once; you touch a lot of  different things, not much in depth, but you see what goes by. I need to  find a way to balance that with the "I want to take an afternoon and  sprint on learning X" thing for the list of X's that I've compiled so  far. I think I'll think about this post-release, though. Only a few more  days.</p>
