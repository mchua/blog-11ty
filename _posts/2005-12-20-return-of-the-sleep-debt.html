<p>It's been a long time since I felt this familiar burning in my brain. It's the heavy "boy I need sleep but I'm still being productive!" stupor that comes from sleeping 3 hours out of the last... 60 or so. Oddly enough, I'm not particularly tired. And the things I've gotten <span style="font-style: italic;">done! </span>I can't believe I used to be in this state all the time. I'm wondering how I can get back to it more.</p>
<p>But my eyes are beginning to burn; they've gotten unused to being open this long after nearly a year without an all-nighter. Instead of pulling a double, I'm going to take a nap in a half-hour or so and regain my ability to see without pain; today's a big day and I wouldn't want to sleepwalk through Expo for the world.</p>
