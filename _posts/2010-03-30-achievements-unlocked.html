<p>On a completely unrelated note to the previous post, today I learned the notion of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspended_chord">suspended chords</a>, which now enable me to play songs like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60x5FHpwY8g">"Boulevard of Broken Dreams"</a> on the guitar. In other news, I've also figured out how to quickly slide my hand up and down the fretboard while changing chord shapes, thanks to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGL-ojxKkTo">"Virginia Moon."</a> I have not, however, nailed the fingerpicking pattern on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BTzNX5OMN4">"Stop This Train"</a> - that's probably something that needs to wait until I get back to my guitar, the one that fits my tiny hands. I <i>like</i> this instrument. And it's portable!</p>
