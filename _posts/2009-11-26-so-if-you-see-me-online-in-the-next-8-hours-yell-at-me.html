<p>Advantage of Thanksgiving day: free time, occupied family (cooking), more space and time for me to do the things I've wanted to do since leaving for Singapore.</p>
<p>Disadvantage of Thanksgiving: remembering to use it for the right things (right now, butternut squash soup preparation, <i>not</i> reading through my email/feedreader backlog or gleefully traipsing through Wikipedia articles on things I was interested in). Besides, if I don't start now, the pie will not be baked in time.</p>
