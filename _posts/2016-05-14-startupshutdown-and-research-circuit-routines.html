<p>One of the best things I've started to do consistently this semester is to think of my research work the same way I think about my physical training. I do equipment setup, warmup, cooldown, and takedown for all my workouts and rehearsals... so why not for my scholarly life?</p>
<p>This isn't an analogy. As an experiment, I'm taking it as literally as possible and doing my research <em>as a workout</em>, with various research tasks as a part of circuits that include planks, rows, turkish get-ups, and so forth.</p>
<p><strong>Sample circuit: </strong>As many rounds as possible (AMRAP) in 2 hours (I usually get through 3-4 circuits).</p>
<ul>
<li>Shoulder mobility circuit, 20 each of T/Y/L/Ws (similar to <a href="http://www.stack.com/exercise/3208/physioball-shoulder-stability-circuit-y-t-w-l">this set of exercises</a>, but standing)</li>
<li>Read and sticky-note a chapter in the book I'm reading. If all chapters are sticky-noted, type notes from one chapter into <a href="http://blog.melchua.com/2015/01/28/how-i-use-zotero-to-take-research-reading-notes/">my personal Zotero format</a>.</li>
<li>2 turkish get-ups on each side, using kettlebell of appropriate weight</li>
<li>5 kettlebell haloes in each direction</li>
<li>Complete and send feedback/assessment on one student project (20 minute maximum; set a timer)</li>
<li>10 straight-leg situps, 10 burpees; another 10 straight-leg situps, another 10 burpees</li>
<li>Write setup/context paragraph before one piece of data in a dissertation chapter</li>
<li>At least 5 minutes of recovery, during which I <em>must </em>drink water.</li>
</ul>
<p>This circuit changes each time I do work, depending on what I need to get done. However, there are some consistent things.</p>
<p><strong>Setup checklist</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Put on appropriate clothes (in my case, I need to be able to move my shoulders so they don't get stiff; this might mean changing a shirt or taking off a jacket).</li>
<li>Ergonomics setup: wristguards on, or monitor raised and external keyboard in position.</li>
<li>Earbuds ready, music set up (FocusAtWill)</li>
<li>Water bottle (+ coffee, if applicable) on the table.</li>
<li>Notebook and pen open to the next blank page.</li>
<li>Pomodoro timer (Toggl button) ready to go.</li>
<li>"Locating" text document from the end of last work session open</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Warmup (every time): </strong> Once everything in the setup checklist is complete, I do this; it should take 20 minute max.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Shoulder muscle routine (combination of arm circles and other light mobility work)</li>
<li>Use "Locating" document and notebook/text editor to design the current day's research sprints/circuits</li>
<li>...then do my physical warm-up (a ~5 minute series of stretches, squats, etc. that I do each time)</li>
<li>...and then sprints/circuits can begin.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Cooldown (every time): </strong>This should take about half an hour max.</p>
<ol>
<li>One short (10-15 minute) pomodoro to get to a good closing place on whatever I have worked on that day.</li>
<li>Stop pomodoro timer, put away.</li>
<li>Stop music, put away earbuds.</li>
<li>Clear browser tabs and open documents on my computer.</li>
<li>Gather up water bottle, coffee/food and walk to put it away. Before returning to my computer from this trip, I think about (1) what I need to characterize about where I've left off to locate myself, and (2) whether tomorrow's-Mel needs to keep anyting else in mind.</li>
<li>Return to computer and type those things into "Locating" text document for tomorrow. Make this the first thing I'll see when the laptop opens.</li>
<li>Close laptop. I'm no longer allowed to open it again for the day.</li>
<li>Put away ergonomics setup.</li>
<li>Arm circles,  trunk spirals, and cooldown stretch routine.</li>
<li>Shutdown complete; pack everything inside my bag, clean up any additional items, and I'm done.</li>
</ol>
