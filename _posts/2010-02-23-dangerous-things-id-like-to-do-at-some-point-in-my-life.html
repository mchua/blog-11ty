<p>I realize I'm likely to have a time limit on these, so I'd better start figuring this out while I'm still in my twenties. Not all of them are all that dangerous - actually, there are tons of safety considerations for all of them - but they'll still take plenty of prep. (I'm in no shape to do any of them now, but that's being worked on.)</p>
<p>1. Kitesurfing.</p>
<div class="youtube-video"><object height="344" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/0b1_1vE8eoA&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/0b1_1vE8eoA&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" height="344" width="425"></embed></object></div>
<p>2. Wingsuit. This implies learning to skydive first. (Note that I don't <em>have</em> to plummet off the side of a cliff; I'm fine hopping out of a plane.)</p>
<div class="youtube-video"><object height="344" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/ttz5oPpF1Js&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/ttz5oPpF1Js&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" height="344" width="425"></embed></object></div>
<p>3. Motorcycling. This is the first one I'm going to be tackling; Liz, Kelcy, Ginneh, and I all want to get our licenses, and have been talking about taking classes this spring for quite some time. I look forward to my early birthday present, and figuring out the logistics (logistical logistics and financial logistics) of having a bike in Raleigh this summer.</p>
<p>4. Speaking of bikes - someday I'd like to bike across the US. This one will probably be with my brother Jason once he graduates from Stanford.</p>
<p>5. Compete in a martial arts tournament - freestyle sparring.</p>
<p>There are other things I'd like to learn - parkour, skateboarding, skiing (or maybe snowboarding), etc - but those will be tackled as opportunities come up. Some of the things I'm working on (rock climbing, soccer) are steps towards other things - strong forearms for non-RSI-ness, the ability to run and react to the movement of others around me but not physically touching me (something I've traditionally been pretty lousy at since I don't have auditory peripheral awareness) - but these five are on my Actual List of Things to Do.</p>
<p>At the moment, though, I still struggle to complete a single pull-up. So... there is progress to be made.</p>
