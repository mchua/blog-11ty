<p>We learn things at conferences! Here are some notes from the last one I attended (FIE, or Frontiers in Education, an engineering edu conference I attend most years).</p>
<p>I learned (via Margot Vigeant) that I'm not the only comic-drawing engineering education researcher. She's doing visual work in the discipline, as is Lucas Landherr (who, like Margot, is a chemical engineer).</p>
<p>Also via Margot was a heads-up about <a href="https://hieroglyph.asu.edu/about/">Project Hieroglyph</a>, an initiative at ASU that paired sci-fi writers with researchers to "provide not just an idea for some specific technical innovation, but also to supply a coherent picture of that innovation being integrated into a society, into an economy, and into people’s lives." I couldn't think of a better framing example for what I'm trying to do with my "alternate universe engineering/tech/computing education cultures" work, which is still in those lovely early stages of "I have no idea what I'm doing with this." Stories. Stories are so important.</p>
<p>I got the opportunity to catch up with several friends, including James Huff (whose work on shame in engineering edu with Nikki Sochacka and Jo Walther is something I am <em>so looking forward to</em>) and Ana Rynearson (who is starting a new program at Campbell), and Allison Godwin (who has <em>very good </em>NSF CAREER award advice). And Rebecca Christianson and Siddharthan Govindasamy, who are wrapping up the 3rd year of the QEA experiment and have stories to tell, and and and and...</p>
<p>And meet new ones! It was a <em>tremendous</em> pleasure to meet Adam Masters, who is looking at makerspaces designed specifically for marginalized groups, and who I <em>really </em>want to collaborate with on the "alternate universe curricular cultures" thing at some point down the line. And Julianna Ge, who is pursuing the fascinating notion of "engineering thriving" (thesis: if you're successful in engineering academics and are thoroughly miserable, we're not doing a great job with engineering education for you yet). Which reminds me that I should introduce the two of them.</p>
<p>Oh, and I got to spend more time with the incomparable Tess Edmonds, which is always a great joy. She also was the third performer in the special session that Ian Smith, Samir Jain, and I did on an alternate-universe engineering culture where engineering is dominated by Deaf people, and hearing(ness) is seen as a disability... more on that later, I hope. But right now, conference happiness. And a lot of catching-up on email.</p>
