<p class="quote">Ran across this quote and went <i>oh yes</i>.</p>
<blockquote><p class="quote">This is the true joy in life, the being used for a purpose recognized by yourself as a mighty one; the being a force of nature instead of a feverish selfish clod of ailments and grievances complaining that the world will not devote itself to making you happy. I am of the opinion that my life belongs to the whole community and as long as I live it is my privilege to do for it whatever I can. I want to be thoroughly used up when I die, for the harder I work, the more I&nbsp; live. I rejoice in life for its own sake. Life is no 'brief candle' to me. It is sort of a splendid torch which I have a hold of for the moment, and I want to make it burn as brightly as possible before handing it over to future generations. --George Bernard Shaw</p>

<p class="quote">That's all. I fly back from Shanghai to Raleigh in a few hours, and then my work travel for the summer will be done. <i>Phew.</i></p>
