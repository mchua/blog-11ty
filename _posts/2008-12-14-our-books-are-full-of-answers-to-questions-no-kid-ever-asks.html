<p>I saw this quote in the context of a slide deck on engineering education (K-12) and it was presented as an "we're teaching them things they don't care to learn" sense.</p>
<blockquote><p>"Our books are full of answers to questions no kid ever asks." --Svein Sjøberg</p></blockquote>
<p>I see that another way as well. There are some books that blew my mind as a kid <em>because</em> they asked questions I had never asked, gave answers to questions that I had never thought or cared about before reading those books. Their answers made me ask more questions.</p>
<p>Learning how to ask questions is an important thing, and how you ask and how you learn is different in each discipline; last week I told Kevin I probably wasn't yet ready to play <em>Jump Monk</em> (which I'd chosen) on the piano "because I'm still just playing notes, I don't know how to ask questions about this." The gauge I'm using each week to see if I'm ready to study <em>Jump Monk</em> is "can I think of questions to ask about this piece other than 'what questions should I ask'?"</p>
<p>When something's too easy, you have no questions; when it's too hard, you can't ask questions. When you can learn from it, you're trying to articulate questions, and you know you <em>are</em> learning from it when you can ask them clearly. Books that ask (and answer) questions no kid - or maybe only the very rare kid - asks themselves can be books that expand your world.</p>
<p>I remember walking down the hallways of my middle school holding <em>The Origin Of Species </em>in front of my face, navigating solely by peripheral vision (I did this for a lot of books) because I couldn't put the it down, couldn't let the gorgeous spinning thread of thought go <em>snap! </em>and crumble back into itself until I had made expanding picture of the world something that would <em>stay</em>. I had to hold ideas in my mind solid enough to make them real. I couldn't do it by myself; my thoughts were still too tenuous. Walking my mind down Darwin's thought-path helped me carve them out. George Pólya gave me the words I needed to articulate my fumblings that had previously gone along the lines of "but how do you <em>know</em> things like the square of a right triangle's hypotenuse is the sum of the squares of the other sides? There must be more than just saying that it <em>is</em>." Lightman and Thomas showed me there were others in the universe who saw the beauty that I was discovering as I plunged through books by Feynman, Hawking, Newton, Euclid (the last two with great difficulty, and I <em>still</em> don't really understand them), and also things outside of science; Frankl, Gardner (both Howard and Martin), Goldberg, Trumbo... there were just worlds and worlds and worlds I didn't ask about because I didn't know that they existed. (There are still worlds that I'm just not aware of. )</p>
<p>It was - and is - like being a small kid at the table who wanted <em>that thing! now!</em> and was whimpering with the frustration of unarticulated expression until somebody said "Mel, would you like a cookie?" <em>Yes! That's the thing I want! May I have a cookie, please?</em></p>
<p>Answering questions that have not yet been asked (but could be, maybe should be) can sometimes be a very, <em>very</em> good thing.</p>
