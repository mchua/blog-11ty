<p>Blues scale. 12-bar blues progression. Walking bass lines and augmented chords with sharp fifths and learning the proper names of note combos I'd made up my own terms for years ago but never thought to say out loud to other people (who would I say them to?) Music! Why didn't I <i>study</i> this before? I need to make up for so many years of lost time. Glory!</p>
<p>Mako's and the sheer firehose magnitude of the bandwidth is <i>fantastic.</i></p>
<p>Also, <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/">Berkman</a>? BRAIN EXPLODES WITH AWESOME. I LOVE EVERYTHING. So very, very happy right now.</p>
<p>And tired. Very tired. I think. That I should go to bed.</p>
