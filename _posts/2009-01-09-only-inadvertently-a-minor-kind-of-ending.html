<p>Happy moments today (also: talking with Brian Jordan about deployments, promising to return Henry's books, plans for lunch next week, <i>being here</i>....)</p>
<p><b>11:32am:</b> Oh... my god. I am <i>so proud</i> of the IMSA students right now. Arjun and Katie and Jason are standing up there pwning everything; their presentation has started a great discussion with a tough audience of very, very smart people at FUDCON.</p>
<p><b>1:30pm:</b> Scott and the IMSA students head out - we'll meet again soon. I'm due for a visit to Chicago in the next few months...</p>
<p><b>4:15pm:</b> Martin jokes on #olpc-meeting (the last meeting as employees for many of us) that we should rebase to Debian Potato; the entire Amoeba breaks out in shared laughter, though we're all silently typing into our screens. This is the bit that I will miss.</p>
<p><b>5pm:</b> I think... that right now, I am the happiest person in the world. (Not for the reason you may think, though. Can't say why quite yet.)</p>
<p>Now an email, then to Bernie's. It's a beginning.</p>
