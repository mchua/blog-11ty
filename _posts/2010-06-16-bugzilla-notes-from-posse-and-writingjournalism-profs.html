<p>The I'll block out an hour or two on IRC to "push this patch upstream," so to speak.</p>
<p>Thanks to Andrea Hickerson for nudging me, via her remote presence, to actually take good notes today - I hope Antonio Mondragon's remote presence tomorrow will do the same. Remotees keep me honest about "upstreaming" our conversations and our notes to the broader community, where more people can benefit from them in - including us, the original participants in the conversation, since we'll get to hear more thoughts and feedback from more people.</p>
<p>Speaking of Andrea, professors of Journalism, English, Technical Writing, and so forth may be interested in the <a href="http://andreahickerson.blogspot.com/2010/06/posse-day2-and-3.html?showComment=1276743532276#c9145381446246023163">comment</a> I left on her blog post from today, which points to several projects that she might want to look at for her students to join (complete with "join" URLs, mailing list info, and individual names and links to contact information from folks I think are good starting points within those communities). </p>
<p><a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Pcalarco">Pascal</a> (<a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FWN">Fedora Weekly News</a>), <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Rbergero">Robyn</a> (<a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Marketing">Fedora Marketing</a>), <a href="http://www.harihareswara.net/">Sumana</a> (<a href="http://gnomejournal.org/">GNOME Journal</a>), and others in the "writing + FOSS == WIN!" domain -&nbsp; if you're looking for new contributors, <a href="http://andreahickerson.blogspot.com">Andrea Hickerson</a> and <a href="http://chronicgadgetosis.wordpress.com/2010/06/16/posse-day-two-oy/">David Shein</a> may make good folks to ping; they both teach in the writing-esque sphere at the college level and are keen on getting their students into FOSS contribution.</p>
