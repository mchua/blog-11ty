<p><a href="http://www.theamericanscholar.org/su08/elite-deresiewicz.html">Food for thought</a>, courtesy of my brother.</p>
<p>Last night I flopped down and almost immediately had vivid, color-saturated dreams involving longboards with laminated wood decks and a Parallax Hydra 32360 (yes, that <i>exact</i> board; I have no idea why), woke up feeling absolutely terrible, rested a little more and then went in to work.</p>
<p>A conversation with David last night, towards the tail end of the hackathon, is burnt into my brain. I don't know what it means yet.<br />
<blockquote>"It's human nature. Most people want power."<br />"I don't <i>want</i> it. I'm trying to avoid it."<br />"We've noticed."<br />"That I run the hell away from power?"<br />"That you give it to others."</p></blockquote>
<p>Went on a manic rush yesterday to hand off as many responsibilities as I could muster. I am not bringing my computer to LA, nor am I bringing a book. Blank notebook, pens. Clothing and toiletries, wallet, cell phone and camera + chargers, backpack. That's all. Maybe not even the camera.</p>
<p>Today: Blazing through repairs during a workshop, reflashing 50 XOs for a testbed; physical work feels good, and gives my overtaxed brain something to cling to, focus on.</p>
<p>I have no patience for meetings that don't fully engage all of their participants at any given time. Presentations, too. That's probably why I run hackathons and brainstorm sessions and open spaces and avoid talking <i>at</i> people when I can. Given this, I would love the challenge of teaching a class or workshop or giving a speech to a crowd of over 300 people. How to do?</p>
