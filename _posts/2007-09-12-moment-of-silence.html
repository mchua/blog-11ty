<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Two Olin students were in a motorcycle accident this weekend. They didn't make it.</p>
<p>I was just on campus to visit last week. Didn't meet Rachel, since she just started this year and I've graduated. But I saw Matt in passing, promised I'd send him that email I owed him - it was waiting in my inbox to be sent when I next hit the internet, but I saw the email with the news that he'd passed away first. Can't imagine what it must be like on campus right now. In a school with only 300 students, the loss of two hits home hard. And it's hard to imagine that someone you know, just a little younger than yourself (they were both 19) has died.</p>
<p>Hope everyone out in Needham is doing ok.</div>
