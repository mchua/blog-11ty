<p>Robin asked me to try drawing what I was thinking. Here's what happened. It peters out at the end where I start waving my hands around and going "I, I, I need to study this post-structuralism thing in Ohio in the spring," but I'm actually fairly happy with everything up to the last two frames as something that might be understandable by folks from pretty much any discipline and from outside academia. (Maybe I need to explain radical transparency more?)</p>
<p>Anyhow. I wonder if the NSF would accept a (better) variant of this as one of the two pages of my fellowship research proposal, or if they'd just look at me funny.</p>
